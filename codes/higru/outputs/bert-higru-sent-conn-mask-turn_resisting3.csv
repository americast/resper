306,30,The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.,0,0
307,34,Not really.,0,0
308,34,I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.,0,0

743,6,"Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.",0,3
744,7,Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.,0,5

746,8,"However, I usually just give where I feel I need to and if people use it the wrong way, I believe they will get what's coming to them.",0,5
747,9,Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.,0,5
748,11,Well I'm sure there is always more that can be done.,0,0
