361,0,I think it's a scam,5,0
362,0,I don't believe it.,5,5
363,0,There is no way to prove where all those funds go.,5,5
364,0,Plus there are starving children right here in america,5,2
365,0,That is all your opinion.,2,0
366,0,You have no facts to back that up.,2,0
367,0,Like I said those are opinions.,2,0
368,0,There are no facts that prove that to be true.,5,0
369,0,There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.,5,0

376,0,"I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.",3,5
377,0,They also don't disclose their funds,5,5
378,0,"No, I care aboutkids in my community, who are in poverty.",3,0
379,0,I have never seen this organization help them.,3,2
380,0,I'd rather contribute my donation locally.,3,7
381,0,Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.,5,5
382,0,How long are you going to take to respond?,2,0
383,0,You're making this take far too long!.,2,0
384,0,How does that equate to reporting financial information?,2,4
385,0,That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.,2,0
386,0,"There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.",2,0
387,0,You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.,5,0

417,13,This is true but alot of charities don't represent the individuals they portray to help.,5,5
418,16,Ok if that were true what is their succession rate of getting through to the children or progression rate.,4,4
419,19,Thats program services not to the kids themselves.,5,4
