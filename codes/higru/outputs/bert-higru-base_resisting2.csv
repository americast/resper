0,1,Hello!,0,0
1,4,I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.,0,0
2,6,I feel really torn about the crisis.,0,0
3,6,I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.,2,0
4,6,At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.,3,0
5,10,I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.,6,4
6,10,"I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".",6,4
7,10,I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.,6,0
8,10,Sorry Im getting off topic.,0,0
9,17,With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.,3,0
10,17,My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.,0,0
11,17,SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.,0,0
12,17,I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!,0,0
13,21,I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.,0,0
14,21,They are the weak ones in my eyes.,0,0
15,24,I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.,0,0
16,24,I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.,0,0
17,29,I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.,0,0
18,29,I would lock into half.,0,0
19,31,I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!,0,0

53,8,I did not have to worry about those things.,0,0
54,8,Both of my parents were employed and were able to provide for me and my siblings.,0,0

429,0,I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.,7,0
430,0,This goes into a different fund.,7,0
431,0,But I would like to be able $150 to this charity.,0,0
432,0,I can donate the .30 base payment but I am still very curious on donating outside the HIT.,0,5
433,1,Certainly as long as I know the donation will help the children,0,0
434,3,I would certainly be willing to donate then,0,0
435,4,I would be willing to donate $200,0,0

437,10,Yes you can count on my donation,0,0
438,11,Thank you Glad I was able to helpthis organization with my donation,0,0
439,12,I could certainly ask some of my coworkers and tell them about the match if they donate at least $500 and tell them what a worthy cause it is.,0,0
440,13,We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations,0,0
441,16,Alright I will ask my co-workers,0,0

460,1,I guess that is true.,0,0
461,1,I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.,0,0

479,0,"No, I didn't see anything.",0,0
480,0,I'm a little familiar with the charity though.,0,0
481,0,That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.,0,0
482,0,We know it's a problem not just in the United States.,0,4
483,0,I most likely will.,0,0
484,0,"I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.",1,0
485,0,How do they help children in other parts of the world?,4,4
486,0,That would be alright.,0,0
487,0,"Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.",0,0
488,0,I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.,0,0
489,0,I'm sure Save the Children helps them?,0,0
490,0,"Yes, I agree.",0,0
491,0,It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.,0,0
492,0,Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.,0,0
493,0,"So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.",0,0
494,0,Good for them.,0,0
495,0,"I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.",0,0
496,0,Ok.,0,0
497,0,"I'm ready to donate, tell me how!",0,0

505,0,What sort of assistance do they offer specifically?,4,4
506,0,"Wow, they really help people all around the world.",0,0

517,0,I'll gladly give all of my payment.,0,0
518,0,Hello,0,0
519,0,"Nope, what do you recommend?",0,0
520,0,What's Save the Children all about?,4,4
521,0,Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?,4,4
522,0,"Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too",3,0
523,0,That would work best for me.,0,0
524,0,That way i know where my money is going.,0,0
525,0,Is there a minimum to donate?,0,4
526,0,That's great!,0,0

532,0,"I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.",0,0
533,0,It was great chatting with you.,0,0
534,0,And thanks for helping!,0,0
535,1,I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.,7,0
536,1,I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.,3,0
537,3,I know that it is a good organization and I support them.,0,0
538,3,However I am not getting a reward from this hit.,0,0
539,3,I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.,5,0
540,3,I want the money to do with as I choose.,3,0
541,5,I still do not want to make a donation from this money.,7,0
542,8,Yes I do think that they do.,0,0
543,9,I do not want to make a donation today.,7,0
544,10,I am not going to waste the reward.,7,0
545,10,I use it for things that my family needs.,5,0
546,13,We work for everything that we have.,5,0
547,13,Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.,5,0
548,15,It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.,7,0
549,19,I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.,3,0
550,19,Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation.,3,0
551,22,I will not donate anything $0.,7,0
552,0,Great what about you?,0,0
553,0,Do you donate to children's charities often?,0,0
554,0,I have donated to them in the past.,0,0
555,0,Do you donate through MTurk only?,0,0
556,0,"I would, I usually donate some portion of my winnings when it's a children's charity.",0,0
557,0,They are the most vulnerable in society.,0,0
558,0,"I know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive.",0,0
559,0,I donate to the NYC Food bank also.,0,0
560,0,They help a lot of city kids.,0,0
561,0,How much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?,0,0
562,0,I usually donate like I would in real life...,0,0
563,0,like a quarter here and a quarter there.,0,0
564,0,"Yes, and it all adds up at the end of the month especially when you're also struggling to make ends meet.",0,0
565,0,"Definitely, I will donate my $0.30.",0,0
566,0,What about you?,0,0
567,0,"Oh, mine just says ""children\'s charity"" but does not mention any specifics.",0,0
568,0,Either way its cool.,0,0
569,0,"Nope, mine doesn't maybe that was the point, to see if I would donate to just any charity. Still I always hope the money actually gets to them.",0,0
570,1,How exactly does it support children in developing countries?,4,4
571,2,What are the donations used for?,4,4
572,3,"These are good things to donate for, but I still don't know exactly how my, or anyone's donations are used directly.",4,0
573,5,"Ok. Utilizing the resources from the research team, what are some challenges for children's education in developing countries?",4,4
574,6,Have you ever made a donation to Save the Children or another charity?,2,0
575,7,What are you primary motivations for making the donations?,0,4
576,8,How many total children has the charity helped since it began?,4,4
577,10,"I love children and think it's incredibly important to help ensure they are educated, in safe conditions and are healthy.",0,0
578,10,Save the Children has not convinced me they can work towards accomplishing those tasks.,6,0
579,12,"I'd like to try and donate at regular intervals, like every month.",0,0
580,12,What would donating like that help inform me on the charity?,0,4
581,13,I understand.,0,0
582,13,"However, I think I'll opt for a one time 0.05 donation instead.",0,0
583,2,"Hello, I am doing good, alright lets get started!",0,0
584,3,"I don't currently, I have donated to an animal shelter a few months ago however.",0,0
585,4,"Yeah, I like the name, I am curious about it, I would like to know some morea about it.",0,0
586,5,"Oh, that sounds like a really good charity to donate to!",0,0
587,6,"Yeah, I am thinking about donating half of my payment.",0,0
588,9,"I think I will donate $1, it only seems fair.",0,0

593,14,"Alright, I will donate $1.25, it seems reasonable.",0,0
594,1,Good morning.,0,0
595,2,Yes.,0,0
596,2,I have but I can't say I am very familiar with what they do.,0,0
597,3,That sounds right from what I know.,0,0
598,5,That sounds like a very worthy cause.,0,0
599,8,Do you know how much of the donations actually make it to children and how much is used for administrative costs?,4,4
600,11,Thank you.,0,0
601,11,That is good information.,0,0
602,12,Sure.,0,0
603,12,That would be fine with me.,0,0
604,14,"Well, most people suck.",2,0
605,14,Sad but true.,0,0
606,18,Glad to help.,0,0
607,18,I wish I could do more.,0,0
608,18,Doing MTurk to get my student loans paid off so that I can be more generous as a whole.,5,0

619,9,what exactly does the charity do for children?,4,4
620,10,how much can i donate?,0,4
621,11,is 20 dollars okay?,0,0
622,12,yes i am,0,0
623,2,I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.,0,0
624,2,We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.,0,0
625,2,I do have a soft spot for children.,0,0
626,2,"As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.",0,0
627,2,I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.,0,4
628,2,Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.,0,4
629,7,yes I have.,0,0
630,7,"In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.",0,0
631,7,Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.,0,0
632,7,One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.,0,0
633,7,"Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.",0,0
634,10,I believe it could be true.,0,0
635,10,"However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.",0,0
636,10,One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.,0,0
637,10,"If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.",0,0
638,14,"Personally, transparency is especially vital.",0,0
639,14,"When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.",0,0
640,14,"In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.",0,0
641,14,If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.,0,0
642,17,"Honestly, it should be a choice.",0,0
643,17,"I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.",0,0
644,17,"However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.",0,0
645,21,I think so.,0,0
646,21,"Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.",0,0
647,21,"If they don't, it's completely understandable.",0,0
648,21,"In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.",0,0
649,21,"However, every cent counts.",0,0
650,21,It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.,0,0
651,21,It's all about giving.,0,0
652,25,Those are very good questions.,0,0
653,25,It depends on the way they see it.,0,0
654,25,Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.,0,0
655,25,"Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.",0,0
656,25,"Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.",0,0
657,29,"Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.",0,0
658,29,I have seen a lot of people do the same.,0,0
659,29,"I think some people will say ""maybe next time"" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.",0,0
660,29,"When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.",0,0
661,32,Yes I would.,0,0
662,32,I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.,0,0
663,35,I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.,0,0
664,0,Hello,0,0
665,0,I would be willing to donate a portion of my wages,0,0

667,0,What childrens charity is this?,0,4
668,0,I am somewhat familiar with them,0,0
669,0,That is so heartbreaking.,0,0
670,0,Save the children sounds like a wonderful charity to donate to,0,0
671,0,Do they find family's for the children or are they running a orphanage?,4,4
672,0,It's so important that there is a organization looking out for children.,0,0
673,0,I only hope that the money goes directly to children programs instead of being eaten up by overhead costs,6,0
674,0,So you dont actually know how they use the koney?,6,4

684,10,"for sure we must do something, but many people are blind, they see just the green of the money, they dont interact with people to see whats their problems are, i really want to help go in africa or some place but i dont know how i can go with a organization.",2,0
685,12,"this i can do, but i was thinking about actual helping.",0,0
