7,0,"I can't go that low. I was looking for $320, but I'd be willing to lower my price to $280",4,4

19,0,"it's been very well taken care of, you wouldn't even know it was used how about 600 and I'll even help you move it to your vehicle",6,6
20,0,I will take it for $300 if you throw in that printer too.,6,6

39,0,"How about the cushions, any holes?",1,1
40,0,No.  We reupholstered them after we purchased the chairs last fall,0,0
41,0,Cool. I was hoping you would be willing to let them go for a little below your listed price.,0,4
42,0,"I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an unreasonable offer.  Even with the scratches they're still nice chairs!",2,2
43,0,"I believe you. I want to make sure it's a fair price. You want about 26 per chair, I was hoping to get them for about 18 per chair.",4,4
44,0,Would you be willing to split the difference at 22 per chair?,4,4
45,0,I was hoping to pay less because I don't have a truck so I will need to pay a friend to pick them up.,6,6
46,0,"Well, I could deliver them a little bit further than Hayward, if that helps",6,6
47,0,That acutally would help. Would you be willing to do that for the $22 per chair?,0,4
48,0,Yes,0,0

123,0,I am open to deals btu that is less than half of asking.. you need to come up some.,4,2
124,0,I could possibly do 2250 but that is a strain for me,7,2
125,0,"I really do want to get rid of it, but I think that is just way to low for me.",4,7
126,0,It is a nice car and it would be going towards a good home. You could have it gone by this weekend and it would be off your hands. Would you take 2450?,6,2
127,0,I need at least 3200.,3,4

153,0,I would consider $75,4,0
154,0,I feel that is too much since it is damaged already and have to try to repaint and repair it.,2,2
155,0,The paint is very fresh and does not need a new coat. The price I paid last year was $300 so you are getting it for less than 1/3,2,2

402,0,"Wow, that sounds great. I would love to go 65 for that.",4,4
403,0,That seems a little low. I was selling it at an awesome bargain price as it was. I could do $85 but nothing less. I'm sorry.,3,2
404,0,How about 70 If I come pick it up and pay cash.,6,6
405,0,"I'm going against my own judgement, but I think i'll call it a deal. Especially if your picking it up.",0,6
406,0,Great! I would love to pick it up!,0,0

415,0,"possibly, what were you thinking?",0,0
416,0,$4320?,4,4
417,0,could you make it 4400?,4,4

423,0,Are you the only owner?,5,5
424,0,Yes I am the only owner of the vehicle.,0,0
425,0,When was the last time you had the breaks and break pads serviced?,5,5
426,0,The breaks are reliable. I think about 4 months ago I had the pads changed. It needs a tune up in general but the brakes aren't a concern.,0,0
427,0,Has it ever been in any accident?  No matter how minor?,1,5
428,0,"Nope, completely clean slate accident wise.",0,0
429,0,How many miles to the gallon?,5,5
430,0,It's a bigger vehicle. You're looking at around 20. More if it was tuned up a bit.,0,0
431,0,How many cylinders?,5,5

435,0,Has it had regular radiator and transmission flushes?,5,5
436,0,Does this car have automatic windshield wipers like every car ever invented?,0,5
437,0,I would assume so. It's a 2013 Mercedes.,0,0
438,0,You assume so? isn't it yours? Is the title in your name?,1,5
439,0,Yes I have a clear title and a clear VIN.,0,0
440,0,"Alright. I live about 200 miles away, if I were to buy it would you deliver to me?",6,6
441,0,And if it doesn't I could throw some in for you ;),0,6
442,0,"The price is pretty high, very high, can you throw out a more reasonable number?",4,4
443,0,Make me an offer.,0,4
444,0,"My brother works for mercedes, so I might get one through him",4,2
445,0,"OK, then go through him.",0,0

451,0,"as it says in the listing, there are some small ccosmetic issues, but the headphones are in excellent working condition. are you ok with that?",0,0
452,0,Does really work or it just sales pitch,1,1
453,0,"It really works. Guaranteed. If you buy and see it doesn't work, you can return it.",0,0
454,0,Do you accept trades,0,5

462,0,Sounds good,0,0
463,0,Hello,0,0
464,0,"Hi this desk is in pretty good condition, but it's huge",0,0
465,0,So I need a lot of big guys then?,0,5
466,0,"Yeah, you'll definitely need 3 strong guys.  Only 75 bucks though.  Maybe some friends could help you if you're interested",0,0
467,0,Will a 6 foot box truck do?,5,5
468,0,Yeah that'll do.,0,0
469,0,You willing to negotiate since I will have to pay a couple friends?,4,4
470,0,It's already a pretty low price.  I can give it to you for 65.,4,4
471,0,Can you do $60?,4,4
472,0,How about 63 and i'll help you put it in the truck?,6,6
473,0,Ok sounds good.,0,0
474,0,Awesome. It's a deal.,0,0
475,0,How many hours have you used this for?,5,5
476,0,Probably 24.  It's just too big for my small wrist so that's why I'm selling it.,0,0
477,0,can you ship it to me,5,6
478,0,I can ship it to you if you pay what I'm asking for it.  $150,6,6
479,0,it sells list price for 150. I could just get it on amazon with free shipping for that price brand new,1,6
480,0,Well???,0,0
481,0,"well if you aren't willing to sell it less than list price for a used watch, then I don't think we can come to an agreement",1,2
482,0,"I wouldn't call 24 hours used, but if you want to forego the agreement that's okay.",4,2
483,0,I mean you need to get rid of the watch as it's currently useless to you. I'm willing to give you 130,4,2
484,0,I have to pay for shipping which I would naturally insure it for it's value so I'm firm on $150,3,2
485,0,You will never be able to sell it at the same price of a brand new watch. $138 is my final offer,3,3
486,0,"I'll accept $143, again I have to pay for shipping.",4,6
487,0,I can't go above 138. I think an 8% depreciation is fair for a used and open product,3,2
488,0,Hello,0,0
489,0,hi,0,0
490,0,Are you interested in the bike?,0,0
491,0,"Yes very, How old is it?",5,5
492,0,Its 2 years old but it's a rare classic edition with only a limited number of them ever made. My asking price for it is 800.,0,0
493,0,I was hoping to get it closer to 360...,4,4
494,0,Wow that's pretty low for a limited edition. I think it might be fare to meet you half way. The lowest I can absolutely go is 600 final offer,3,3
495,0,"I really don't think I can afford that, my best  and most I can afford would be 500.",3,7
496,0,Sorry I just cant let it go for that low. Sorry we couldn't reach a deal.,3,3
497,0,"me too , good luck.",0,0
498,0,hi,0,0
499,0,hello,0,0
500,0,i would like to know if you are interested to sell it for $600,4,4
501,0,600 is kind of low. It's a really good bike,4,2
502,0,ok i can buy it for $650. that is the good price,4,4
503,0,I recently put in touring tires,2,6
504,0,what are you expecting,0,0
505,0,I should keep the tires and then just sell you the frame for 650,6,6
506,0,that is funny and smart of you.,0,0
507,0,Just saying,0,0
508,0,ok what is the last price,0,5
509,0,715,3,0
510,0,sounds good to me,0,0
511,0,ok,0,0
512,0,Hi I am interested in your DB Response and toppeak quick track mtx,0,0
513,0,"Alright great, I'm asking 120 for it. It's not very old and is in great condition.",0,0
514,0,2009 is somewhat old have you used it yourself?,5,5
515,0,"Of course, I've been the only owner. It works great, and has been stored in a garage. It's never sat outside.",0,0
516,0,ok would you accept $100 for it?,4,4
517,0,"Woah I don't think I could go that low, how about $111.",4,4
518,0,that is a bit much I am willing to do $106,4,4
519,0,"Meet me in the middle at $108, and deal.",4,4
520,0,sure that sounds great $108,0,0
521,0,Ok thanks.,0,0
522,0,Hello. How can I help you?,0,0
523,0,"Hi, I am interested in the apartment",0,0
524,0,Sure. Do you have any questions?,0,0
525,0,Is it available any sooner than the 10th?,5,5
526,0,No sorry its not available sooner,0,0
527,0,How close is it to town?,5,5
528,0,Its in town and in a very convenient location with everything around the corner,0,0
529,0,does it come furnished?,5,5
530,0,Yes it does,0,0
531,0,"the price is a little out of my range, I'm willing to pay $2480",7,7
532,0,"I am sorry but 2480 is very low for what you are getting back. There is a pool, fitness center, clubhouse, and lots of stuff that you're getting with it. I can give it to you for $2700 nothing lower than that",2,2
533,0,"Ok, that sounds fair",0,0
534,0,Great then we have a deal! Thanks for choosing us!,0,0
535,0,"Hello, are you looking to rent out my inlaw?",0,0
536,0,Yes. Would $900.00 be agreeable?,4,0
537,0,"No, I'm afraid $900 would be far too low. This is in a very desirable area of Oakland, and it even comes with a shared on site laundry.",2,2
538,0,"Then, how about $1,000.00? I'm on a very strict budget, but I need something right away. I'm very quiet, I always pay on time and I have no pets.",7,7
539,0,"That's closer, but I still think $1400 would be a more fair price. I forgot to mention another great benefit of this rental. Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)",4,2
540,0,That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.,2,2
541,0,"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",6,2
542,0,"If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.",6,0
543,0,"Okay, I'll take that deal.",0,0
544,0,Agreed.,0,0
545,0,"Okay, I look forward to practicing my poll dance moves to your music :)",0,0
546,0,I'm interested in your leather sofa. I think it would look great in my living room. Would you take $243?,4,4
547,0,"It is actually a sofa and loveseat, so I can't go that low.  They come from a smoke free and pet free home.  I could go $300",4,2
548,0,Is it soft?,5,5
549,0,Yes and very comfortable,0,0
550,0,"I have a bad back, so I don't want to sink down too far. Would you take $250?",4,4
551,0,You only came up $7?  I tell you what.  I will deliver it to you and $275 is the lowest I can go.,6,6
552,0,Does it clean easily?,5,5
553,0,"Yes, $275?",4,0
554,0,"Could you deliver it today? And could you put it in my house, please? I'm 85 years old.",6,6
555,0,"Yes, no problem, so $275 it is then",0,0
556,0,That'll be fine.,0,0
557,0,HI I would like the bike for my niece.,0,0
558,0,"ok, i'm the potential buyer right?",0,0
559,0,"yes sorry ,",0,0
560,0,that's ok.  I noticed there are no hand brakes.  How old is the bike?,5,5
561,0,"it's almost two years, and the breaks activate when she reverses it",0,0
562,0,"hmmm, two years old is used.  I can offer you 30",4,2
563,0,"trust me *i can show you on skype, is still looks brand new, 40 and you'll never regret it, is it for your niece ?",2,2
564,0,"It's for my granddaughter and I know how hard she rides her current bike - kids are kids, the best I can do is 34 and that's my final offer.",3,3
565,0,"ok for 34 but you will have to come and pick it up , fair enough ?",6,6
566,0,"sure, I'll pick it up.  34 it is.",0,0
567,0,"Cinnamon apartments, may I help you?",0,0
568,0,"Hi, I am very interested in the apartments you have for rent.",0,0
569,0,Will it be just for you or are you going to be moving in with someone else?,0,0
570,0,It would be me and my daughter she is 12.,0,0
571,0,Oh that's excellent. She'll love the neighborhood. I'm asking $2150 for a 2 bedroom with excellent light.,0,0
572,0,"They sound really nice, are there any other amenities like a pool or anything like that?",5,5
573,0,"Yes we have a community pool for the tenants, it's right in the center of the building, where most places have a courtyard. There is also a small gym near the laundry room.",0,0
574,0,"Oh wow nice!  Being a single mom and all the rent is just a little high for me, is it negotiable at all?",7,7
575,0,Let's see what we can do. Where are you coming from? Has your daughter been enrolled in school yet?,4,0
576,0,"Yes we already live in the area, that's why I'd like to keep her in the same district and the location of the apartments is perfect. I could afford $1978 for rent if that is possible. I'd be willing to take a smaller unit.",4,6
577,0,"I'm sorry but I'll have to insist that you stay in a two bedroom. Those are the rules with children. It's very important to use all of the rooms as intended here at Cinnamon Apartments. However, you mentioned the pool earlier. Do you enjoy swimming?",3,0
578,0,"Yes we do. I would still like a 2 bedroom, but I'd be willing to do without the wall to wall closets and breakfast bar.",4,6

624,0,I'm trying to meet in the middle with 212,4,4
625,0,Alright I'll talk to you tomorrow and come get it.The price seems fair enough for a one owner and non smoking.So 212?,0,2
626,0,Correct. Please make an offer!,0,0

642,0,What is your asking price?,5,5
643,0,"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal",0,0
644,0,I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,6,6
645,0,"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no.",4,6
646,0,That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,4,6

657,0,Yes. The $130 includes shipping!,0,0
658,0,I will pay you 98 for it and I will come pick it up.  Since it doesn't come with a warranty I dont want to risk paying to much.,6,6
659,0,"Hmm, 98 is a bit too low for me. I'm looking to get back some of my money here. The item is basically brand new. How about $120?",4,2
660,0,will you throw in a warranty with it?,6,6

1384,0,"Good morning, how are you?",0,0
1385,0,"Great, how about yourself?",0,0
1386,0,Doing well. You're interested in my ad for the BMW X5? It's a great looking vehicle with only 117k miles on it.,0,0
1387,0,"Yeah, I was looking around and it caught my eye. I would be willing to pay $5400 for it right now. I have the cash and could make the payment today. Of course, I would like to take a look at it first and possible take it for a test spin.",6,6
1388,0,"Understood. I'm asking $9,000 for it at the moment. We could definitely arrange for a test drive, but I don't think I can be that flexible on the price.",3,4
1389,0,"Hmm, well I think the asking price is too steep considering the year and the car having 117k miles on it. I just bought a 2011 VW GTI with 56k on it for 9,000. I think I can go up to around $6,500 for this BWM. Anything more is too much in my opinion.",2,2
1390,0,"So while it's a 2006 model, it is a rather large BMW sports utility vehicle.  Luxury SUVs hold their value well and BMW doesn't change their styling much from year to year. I could go $8,000.",2,2
1391,0,"I don't think I can do $8,000.",4,7
1392,0,"Well, this is a great looking vehicle, it was just cleaned and detailed and is really ready to go.",2,0

1414,0,"I meant to say fairly new because I used them once, 120 is too low, I can go down to 190 final",3,2
1415,0,Ok but it doesn't come with an amp which means I would have to buy one,2,2
1416,0,"yes, i might have one that needs a little repair, I could give that to you if you get it a 190",6,6
1417,0,That sounds great do you install as well?,0,5

1429,0,"Yes I'm seeing your messages. Sounds like a good plan. Was just trying to stick to dialogue that is following guidelines, even though we are both buyers. So we'll submit 30 and see what happens. Mine is 110 so I have no clue what will happen.",0,3

1446,0,can you lower the price on it,4,4
1447,0,I could do $240 and transfer the warranty to you. It still has a year on the warranty.,0,6

1450,0,what about 180,4,4
1451,0,I would do 180 if I take out the extra accessories I was throwing in.,6,6
1452,0,in that case i would offer $150,2,4
1453,0,So with all accessories included I suggest we go 200 as that is 50/50 on the original offers,2,6

1469,0,"Ok, I would be willing to pay $8000",4,4
1470,0,"Eh I can't do that I'm afraid. The thing is in such good running condition, and plus it gets over 50MPG which saves a lot on fuel. I was originally going to ask for $9500, but since the side and bumper are a little scuffed I'd be willing to go down to $9.1k",2,2
1471,0,Would you take $8750?,4,4
1472,0,"How about this, the car is registered until February 2019 so that saves you a bunch of hassle. I can deliver it for 9k or if you are still fine picking up then $8900 shouldn't be a problem at all",6,6

1518,0,Okay cool. Has it been in any accidents?,1,1
1519,0,No. I'm a very safe driver. Does $4500 sound good to you?,0,0
1520,0,I could do $3300,4,4
1521,0,That's a bit low for me. I need a little more to put towards the ring I'm buying my fiance. I could part with it for $3900,7,7
1522,0,How about $3500?,4,4
1523,0,Okay. It's a deal,0,0
1524,0,"Great, thanks.",0,0

1530,0,well I have $13 to spend,4,7
1531,0,Ok what are we looking to fix with your computer?,0,0
1532,0,I think It's the fan.  It went out but I don't think that it overheated the computer.,0,1
1533,0,"Ok sounds good, that is slightly cheaper to fix, could you do fourteen. I will allow a discount on your next fix for five dollars off. How does that sound?",6,6
1534,0,ok with the $5 off for my next visit -- that's fair,0,6
1535,0,Sounds good! Thank you for your business!,0,0

1538,0,"yes i am, but the price is out of my current budget, are you willing to lower it to 2450",7,7
1539,0,"I really can't go down that low $3,500 is a fair price can you make a serious offer?",3,3
1540,0,"i was being serious, i mean it doesn't come with electric so i think my offer is pretty reasonable",2,0
1541,0,Actually the guest cottage is the one that doesn't have any electricity if you look at the listing.,2,2
1542,0,"ok 2800 can you work with that?, if i bring my own furniture",6,6
1543,0,"That's still too low. How about $3,200",4,4
1544,0,3000 then we have a deal,3,3
1545,0,3100 and we have a deal,3,3
1546,0,Hello are you still selling the T3,0,0
1547,0,Yes it is still for sale. Are you interested in it?,0,0
1548,0,Yes I'm interested in it. Can you tell me if it's in good condition?,5,5

1552,0,Okay that's great. Would you be willing to come down on the price a little bit?,4,4

1554,0,Okay would you take 950,4,4
1555,0,1000 and we have a deal,3,3
1556,0,hello,0,0
1557,0,Hello. I am very interested in the chairs. I can pay cash and pick them up for $150.00,6,6
1558,0,"I can't sell them for half the asking price, sorry.  The price is firm",2,7
1559,0,"300.00 seems a bit much, especially if I am picking them up and have cash on hand....",2,6
1560,0,Delivery would be $50 extra.  Paying cash does not offer a discount,3,6
1561,0,"yes, but I am not asking for delivery. Cash will save you money in credit card transaction fees. Let's do 200 and I can come pick them up right now",6,6
1562,0,Transactions fees would be less than $5.  I will not go lower than $275.  That is lower than the normal price they sell for every day.  $275 is my final offer.,2,3
1563,0,"unless you have stellar credit card processor, your fees will be closer to 15.00 for 275. 250, cash on hand, I pick up, and will come get them right now.",6,6
1564,0,"$275 is the lowest price.  I cannot get them discounted from my supplier.  Any less, and it is not worth the sale.",3,3
1565,0,"We are talking 25.00 here. I like the chairs, but I am not going over 250.00.",3,4
1566,0,I guess we cannot make a deal then.  You will have to reject my offer.,3,3
1567,0,"okay, then. good luck!",0,0
1568,0,I am interested in this property.  Are there neighbors close by?,5,5
1569,0,"There are some neighbors yes, but the location feels incredibly secluded given the surrounding city.",0,0
1570,0,Would you be able to come down in cost?,4,4
1571,0,Potentially.  I've always hated this carpet my wife chose to put in.  I'd come down a bit just to say that it was because of the carpeting.,0,2
1572,0,Ok.  I would be a great tenant.  I could offer $2000.,4,4
1573,0,I can't go nearly that low.  This property is the upper echelon of homes in this area.  I could accept $3700 though.,2,2
1574,0,Any extra perks you can throw in?  Like paid utilities? Furniture?,6,6
1575,0,"I can't offer to pay your utilities because there's no telling what that cost will be.  However, the home could easily be equipped with solar panels.  Also, it's equipped with a complete set of furnishings and appliances, though I expect you will want to bring at least some of your own.",6,6
1576,0,Ok.  I can move in as soon as you are ready if you can bring the payment to $3500.,6,6
1577,0,$3600 and you've got a deal.,3,3
1578,0,deal,0,0
1579,0,Hello is the place still available?,0,0
1580,0,It's a beautiful condo and yes it is! Move in ready ASAP.,0,0
1581,0,Is it close to any stores? Does it come with appliances?,5,5
1582,0,Close to many shopping centers and all top end appliances are included. There is even a wine fridge in the kitchen. Washer an Dryer is front loading and only 6 months old,0,0
1583,0,"My only issue is the area it's in has a high crime rate, can you come down on the price?",2,2
1584,0,"The crime rate has dropped dramatically since the property values have gone up, but I am willing to comee to some terms with you.",2,2
1585,0,I still see prices much lower than that in the area and the crime rate hasn't gone down all that much. I just checked yesterday. Can you do 1000?,2,2
1586,0,"Not at all. There are far too many upgrades to let it go for that little. My Rock bottom is $1950. I put a lot of money into the granite counters, p graded fixtures and the tile in the condo.",2,2
1587,0,"1500 and I'll even sign a longer lease, I know that's worth something.",6,6
1588,0,$1750 and a 24 month lease that's really all I can do.,3,3
1589,0,"1600 and the same terms and we have a deal. I am a great tenant as well, cleanest background check you'll ever see.",6,3
1590,0,I'm sorry that is just too low. I will not make up the difference even with your 24 month lease. I'm sorry we couldn't come to an understanding. $1750 is final offer,2,3
1591,0,"Hello, that's a nice-looking chair",0,0
1592,0,"Hi, it is , very modern mid century style, $75 is the price",0,0
1593,0,"what is the seat madde of. Is it fabric, or a resin material?",5,5
1594,0,Fabric,0,0
1595,0,Are the legs wood?,5,5
1596,0,yes they are,0,0
1597,0,"Ar there any tears or snags in fabric, or any stains on it?",1,1
1598,0,"not at all, the chair is in perfect condition, how much do you offer?",0,0
1599,0,Are there any scratches or mars on the legs?,1,1
1600,0,"no, the legs are in good shape",0,0
1601,0,I do think your asking is a bit high. Would you accept $40?,4,4
1602,0,Hello,0,0
1603,0,Hello,0,0
1604,0,This is a great Honda; so excellent I'm thinking it's worth $6900.,0,0
1605,0,I don't think it's worth that much. It's a 12 years old car.,2,2
1606,0,"True, but it has power seats and a cd player.",2,2
1607,0,i like the power seats but cd player is outdated to me.,2,2
1608,0,"Good point, and I guess it can catch fire. How do you feel about $6000?",4,4
1609,0,KBB says it's only worther about $3500. Would you consider $4000?,2,2
1610,0,I'd really like to get $5800. Can we meet at $5000?,4,4
1611,0,It's too high for me. My budget is around $4000,7,7
1612,0,"I see. I can come down to $4200, which is one hundred times the answer to everything in the universe, and a very fair price.",4,3
1613,0,how about $4100? it's only $100 different but would help me a lot. I can also come to pick up the car so you don't have to deliver.,6,6
1614,0,"I'm not happy about it, but I need to sell. Agreed.",0,0
1615,0,hello,0,0

1754,0,Hello. Beautiful car!,0,0
1755,0,"Thanks, it is a great little car.",0,0
1756,0,What's the milage on it?,5,5
1757,0,It only has 15k miles on it. I only drive it on weekends.,0,0
1758,0,Are you the orignal owner?,5,5
1759,0,"Yep, I'm the only owner and I've never let anyone else drive it. I've kept up on all the maintenance and have driven it very carefully.",0,0
1760,0,Why are you parting with it?,1,1
1761,0,I got a brand new one.,0,0
1762,0,Nice! The price is a little steep for a 10 year old car and without warranty those german cars are expensive to work on.,2,2
1763,0,Yeah if you don't have a good mechanic near you I guess that could be a problem. I've been lucky to have lots of great shops. I'm not in a hurry to sell it though.,0,2
1764,0,How long is the warrranty on it?,5,5
1765,0,I'm sure it is long expired. But I mean it is a Porshe. Not really a practical car.,0,0
1766,0,For some it is. Would you take $40K for it?,4,4
1767,0,No that is just way too low. This car is worth what I'm asking for it and I'm not in a hurry to sell it so I can't really justify such a low price. It's a great car in great condition. Has a Chrono sports pakage and full leather package. I can throw in the cover and a set of rims that I once bought for it but never swapped out on it. But I really can't lower the price that much.,2,2
1768,0,If I was able to pick it up today would you go to $50K? I would also be paying in cash.,6,6
1769,0,If you can pay in cash that is definitely a reasonable offer. I will be around today if you want to come check it out and give it a test drive.,0,6

1775,0,"yes i saw that, 40 mpg. does it have a good stereo?",5,5
1776,0,Yes it sounds great.,0,0
1777,0,"nice. would you be willing to lower the price a little, say to 5400, since it was in a fender bender?",2,2
1778,0,"I think that is fair, you got a deal.",0,0
1779,0,great thanks!,0,0

1794,0,"ok well I am a little strapped for cash right now, just opened my own business and got ripped off on some phones I ordered.  Would you be willing to take $20?",7,7
1795,0,Oh that is unfortunate. Do you think you could go to $35?,4,4
1796,0,"Well that is still a little high, I could maybe do $25 and come get them right away.",6,6
1797,0,Can we do $30?,4,4
1798,0,Yes I can do $30 thank you.,0,0
1799,0,Thanks,0,0
1800,0,Hello.,0,0
1801,0,Hello. Why are you selling this?,1,1
1802,0,"A friend bought it for me, but it doesn't fit the rest of my furniture. Plus, I like my old one so I'm getting rid of this one.",0,0

1806,0,"Nope, none. It might have gotten some dust on it but that's it.",0,0
1807,0,"Okay. After you disassembled the unit, did any pieces go missing or are they all still there?",1,1

1810,0,I think I can make that work. Saves me from having to do any driving. Thanks!,0,0
1811,0,"Hi there, are you looking for a new place?",0,0
1812,0,Im interested in the 4bedroom in Pleasanton. Is the neighborhood safe?,5,5
1813,0,very safe and very good school district too. Do you have kids?,0,0
1814,0,Yes I do. That is a great plus. Is it carpet or hardwood? does it have a backyard?,5,5
1815,0,"Just installed new carpet all through and yes, it does have a backyard. not too big though so you dont have to worry about a whole lot of mowing! The neighbors are very nice too",0,0
1816,0,That sounds great! Unfortunately the price is high for me. The offer i can give you is $1675,7,7
1817,0,Unfortunately that's very low for this much space and this neighborhood. The typical rent in this particular area for a similar property is about 3400,2,2
1818,0,Finances are very tight right now. The most I can do would probably be $2500,7,7
1819,0,"I understand finances are tight everywhere, I do but that's below fair market value. I can however do 2800",2,7
1820,0,are you still interested? I can do $2800,0,4

1827,0,Nope. Everything is included.,0,0
1828,0,Wonderful!  Would you take $1203 for it?,4,4
1829,0,"I am afraid that will be too low. The average 1 BR in this area will be $1600. nd with us, everything is included so you don't have to worry paying extra for amenities and parking spot",2,2
1830,0,Ok would you be willing to do $1550?,4,4
1831,0,How about $1600 and all of us can be happy?,4,6
1832,0,Ok sounds great!,0,0
1833,0,Thank you!,0,0
1834,0,Hi! I see you are interested in my tablet.,0,0
1835,0,Yes I am.  It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,5,5
1836,0,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.,0,0
1837,0,Does it come with a warranty?,5,5
1838,0,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.,0,0
1839,0,Did a child play with it?,1,5
1840,0,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.,0,0
1841,0,"May I ask, why are you selling it?",1,1
1842,0,"My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price.",0,0
1843,0,I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking.  Will you take $90?,2,6
1844,0,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal.",6,2
1845,0,"If you can ship it to me and include those accessories, I can go to $125 paid immediately.",6,6
1846,0,"I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra.",2,2
1847,0,Well then $150 seems reasonable.  I can manage that.,0,0
1848,0,Ok. I guess so.,0,0
1849,0,"Okay then it's a deal -- $150 shipped with accessories,",6,0

1894,0,how much are the utilities per month?,5,5
1895,0,"about $200/$250, you wont find a better offer in the area.",2,0
1896,0,A unit next door is available for 2000 per month though. why is this one so high?,2,1
1897,0,"Its higher because it has a better interior design, your welcome to visit both units but you will see theres a big difference between them.",2,2
