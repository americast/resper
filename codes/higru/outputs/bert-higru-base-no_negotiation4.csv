206,0,I had originally got it for $200 but I am now selling it for half the price,0,4
207,0,"I see.  I like the bike. It seems like a good deal, but I am very hesitant to pay $100 for it when it is a year old.  Is there any wiggle room on that price?",2,2
208,0,I could bring it down to $90 that's about it because its not very old.,2,2
209,0,"$90 pretty good, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80.  Maybe we can meet in the middle at $85?",4,4

219,0,"I understand.  How about $11,000 cash -- out the door!!",4,6
220,0,I'm sorry.  That,4,0
221,0,What is the lowest you'll take?,0,0
222,0,The lowest I would consider is $16000.,3,3

224,0,"I can go down to $15000.  But, that is way lower than what I was willing to do originally.",4,3
225,0,"How about we settle at $14,000.  You'll have cash in hand and I'll have a new car.",4,6
226,0,$14500 and you have a deal.,3,3

233,0,"No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone.",2,2
234,0,"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",6,6
235,0,I think we can do that since you're local.  190 for both phones and I will deliver.  How's tomorrow afternoon?,0,0
236,0,sounds good,0,0
237,0,Great!  I hope you enjoy your new phones.,0,0

245,0,"Friend, check out the description of this fine automobile that I posted. It's got a new radiator, fresh tires, I mean, the list goes on!",2,0
246,0,"but friend it's 8 years old, so what about 9850, i think it's fair and I will take care of the delivery charges",2,6
247,0,"Okay, I think that is a fair deal.",0,0
248,0,ok I guess we could write one more line so we don't get rejected,0,0
249,0,I'm not sure what you could possibly be referring to?,0,0
250,0,"because sometime the computers could find out it's was done too quickly and might refuse this , and we have to do it again , you will see in futur tasks",0,0
251,0,"Hello, I am interested in your Chevy. I see that you are asking $5,000, is the price negotiable?",0,0

263,0,"Okay, is the price negotiable?",0,0
264,0,"A little, make me an offer.",4,0
265,0,"I have looked up what this bike is worth and taken into account the new handlebar tape and tires and I would feel comfortable paying $700, would that work.",2,2
266,0,"That is a little low, I understand it needs some things. I would drop the priced to $1,000.",4,2
267,0,"I just can't pay that much, it isn't worth it. How about $775?",2,7
268,0,If you can pick it up today and pay cash I would take $850.,6,6

288,0,I do. Is the original boxes and paperwork with them? Is there a warranty with the parts that will be transferred to me if I purchase them?,5,5
289,0,"Everything that came in the box with them is there, I put it all back in after I realized I wouldn't be able to use them on my bike. Unfortunately the warranty for them is outdated by now, they're in new condition, but they've been sitting for a while.",0,0

291,0,"I am willing to negotiate the price a little lower, that isn't a problem.",0,4
292,0,"If I agree to pick them up, would you be willing to do $22 considering there is no warranty and they have been sitting for awhile.",2,6
293,0,"$22 is a little bit low for me, but I could definitely come down in price if you do pick them up. How about we meet halfway at $25?",6,6
294,0,"Well, it is a bit of a drive for me. I'm sure you want to get rid of these, could you do $23?",6,4
295,0,I suppose that would be about the price it'd cost to ship them out. You've got yourself a deal bud.,0,0

318,0,I would be willing to go for three hundred with the warranty and the free shipping,6,6
319,0,sorry typo there could do. Like I said 350 is really the lowest I can do without taking a big loss myself.,3,3

The security control intercom has allowed me to easily let in my guests but what's also great about the apartment is there is a doorman present.",0,0
574,0,Cool so i'm on a bit of a buget i was wanting to know if i could get the very nice place for $1500,7,4

618,0,Yes I am. Is it new or used?,5,5
619,0,We didn't use it much before my daughter went off to college. She had her computer on it so it's pretty peerless,0,0
620,0,"Okay. How about the drawers? Do they open and close easily or do you need that ""extra push"" to deal with it?",1,5
621,0,"Oh she didn't use the drawers at all, so I'm confident that you could slide them in and out nicely",0,0
622,0,Great. The price is way too high for me. can we negotiate on that?,4,7
623,0,"Yeah, what's your budget? I can't really go lower than 45 because of the chair that's included",3,7
624,0,"Well what if I don't want the chair, can you just give me the table for #36?",6,6
625,0,"Oh, you don't want the chair? Okay, give me 40 and you have a deal",4,0

628,0,"Hey there, I am interested in your bike.",0,0
629,0,yeah this is a nice bike i have to many and decided to sell this one i can't sell it to cheaper than the listed price so if you make an offer don't go to far away from that price,0,2
630,0,Right now i am just looking for a present for my brother's birthday. My budget is around $2500...Do you do 2500? I have saw another bike ad they only sell it for 2300 for almost same condition.,1,7

643,0,"i am really intereted in your bike, however, I do have some financial problems at the moment",7,7
644,0,I am willing to negotiate but I can't go lower than what I have to. This bike is the best thing that I have had and its quality is just too amazing!,3,0
645,0,ok so how about 600 and everyone goes home happy,4,4
646,0,that's too low for what you're getting in return. I can do $800,4,4
647,0,"how about 700 hundred and I ll stop by and pick it up ASAP, come on",6,6
648,0,Okay if you are insisting that much then I will take the 700 but you need to come by latest tomorrow.,6,6
649,0,"sounds great to me, I will see you then, so let finalize ok",0,0
650,0,Sure!,0,0
651,0,Hi,0,0
652,0,Hi there.,0,0
653,0,Are you looking to buy?,0,0
654,0,I am interested in getting this pioneer stereo. It looks like old school. Does it work well?,5,5
655,0,"It is in great condition, has a very high quality performance sound.",0,0
656,0,Is the sound crisp?,5,5
657,0,very and clear.,0,0
658,0,How old have you had it for?,1,1
659,0,I have it two years. But still under warranty that would be transferred to you.,0,6
660,0,Okay that would be great. Although the amount is too much for me. Can we do $120?,4,7
661,0,"I am wanting to make a deal, but feel closer to $175 is fair.",4,4
662,0,I could do $175 if you can deliver it to me please?,6,6
663,0,"yes I could deliver , no problem.",0,0
664,0,Hi.,0,0
665,0,Hi I'm very interested in this. I see it has high speed internet is that included in the price?,5,5
666,0,"Yes, it is included.  among other perks like our 24 hour gym.",0,0
667,0,Can I bring my dog with me?,5,5
668,0,Pets are welcome!,0,0
669,0,Awesome! Could the price be lowered a bit?,4,0
670,0,yes a little,0,0
671,0,Like 1700?,4,4
672,0,I think if you could do 1750.. we could make a deal.,4,6
673,0,I'll take it.,0,0
674,0,I was looking at the BMW you have listed and found myself interested,0,0
675,0,"Great, do you have any questions about it?",0,0
676,0,"I was wondering about the mileage being so high, maybe we could cut down the price to about 4200, being that im going to have to replace the engine and possibly the transmission soon",1,2
677,0,"Well, the mileage is high because I have to travel a lot for business, and this was the car I drove all around the southwest. I'd be willing to let it go for $6000.",2,2
678,0,I like how the interior has been redone and the tow package is installed along with the other work done in the past year. Ill probably go 5200 at the highest. Maybe throw in free shipping to my current location?,6,6
679,0,"I could have it delivered to you next week, for $5500.",6,6
680,0,"Alright, I 'm feelign a little better now, does the car include a warranty of any kind?",5,5
681,0,"Well, it did, in 2008. It's been out of warranty for a few years now.",0,0
682,0,"With a clean title and everything listed, I think I could settle at 5500 on a payment plan over a year. If we could make it 5300, I could pay straight cash.",6,6
683,0,"Okay, 5300 is fine.",0,0
684,0,Thank you so much!,0,0
685,0,Hi. How many miles are on this car?,5,5
686,0,65000 original miles. It has been well maintained and I have all the records.,0,0
687,0,"Great! Last week I saw a similar vehicle with 70000 miles for 14,500. So 20000 is too high for me. Would you be willing to take $15200?",4,0
688,0,"It comes with an extra transmission, radiator, fuel pump and I will warranty it for 10000 miles or 18 months whichever comes first.",6,6
689,0,"Ok. Are you willing to take $15500? I can have a buddy come with me to pick it up, so you don't have to worry about moving it anywhere.",6,0
690,0,I can't go that low. I could do 19000 but no extra transmission at that price.,4,6
691,0,"Ok. Since you want 19000 and I want 15500, let's meet in the middle and settle on 17250, with no extra transmission. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?",4,4
692,0,I'll go 17250 with no warranty and no extra transmission.,6,6
693,0,How about 18000 and include the warranty?,6,6
694,0,Ok I'll do that.,0,0
695,0,I love the look of your chair! I have a couple of questions: What time period is the frame from? When was it reupholstered? Why are you getting rid of it?,1,5
696,0,"It's not too old maybe about 50 years or so, but it is hand made in the old european tradition. everything on it is original, sturdy well made no creaking. i'",0,0
697,0,What is the material on the back and cushion made of?,5,5
698,0,"chat misbehaved. sorry about that. i'm selling it because i don't need it anymore. and need some quick cash. as for the materials for the back and cushion, i don't really know, i think it might be double weaved cotton? Not sure.",0,1
699,0,"In looking at comps, and this being not as old as it appears, would you be willing to negotiate on the price? I am thinking $175. I will pick up and load myself",6,6
700,0,Sure but I can't go that low. The lowest I can go is about 300. I can deliver it for you,6,6
701,0,How about 250 if I come pick up?,6,6
702,0,tell you what. 275 and you got a deal,4,3
703,0,Let's split the difference and go $260.,4,4
704,0,you come and pick it up? fine that's a deal,6,6
705,0,You betcha. Thanks!,0,0
706,0,"Hi, what can I tell you about this bike? It's really cool and is vintage!",0,0
707,0,"Yes, I can see that!  Are all the parts original Schwinn?",5,1
708,0,Yes they are! They're in great condition too.,0,0
709,0,No rust?,1,1
710,0,No rust at all. It rides really smoothly and I've never had a problem with rusting in the 10 years I've owned the cruiser,0,0
711,0,What about the chain.  Has it ever been replaced or is it the original chain,1,5
712,0,"No, it's the original!",0,0
713,0,I'm asking because we don't have a Schwinn store in the area and I hate to order parts online.,0,0
714,0,"The original makes it more vintage and classic, to be honest. Also, apologies-- I actually forgot to tell you the tires are new and they're Kendra, not Schwinn. But you'd want new tires anyways since new tires are what keep the cruiser riding smoothly. You wouldn't want tires from the 60s.",0,2
715,0,"Lol It was a good time, but yeah, you're right.  Ok, so what's the rock bottom price you would accept for this beauty?",4,0
716,0,I'd be willing to sell for $200.,4,4
717,0,Ouch!!  My budget is very tight and I want this bike soooooooo bad.  Would you be willing to accept 190?,7,7
718,0,Sure. $190 is fine.,0,0
719,0,Great!,0,0
720,0,"Hello, I am interested in you iPad mini. Is it still available?",0,0
721,0,"Yes, it is!",0,0
722,0,"Great, is the price negotiable?",4,4
723,0,"Somewhat, but this is in amazing condition and it includes the case.",0,0
724,0,I actually have a case so I don't need or want the case. You can keep it and sell it separately.,6,0
725,0,"Okay, without the case I would be asking $165.",6,6
726,0,This is a first gen model and only has 32GB. I would like to pay $75.,4,2
727,0,There is no way I can do that. I would be happy to take $150.,4,3
728,0,I just don't see that it is worth that. How about $100.,4,4
729,0,"I would be willing to meet you in the middle, but I cannot take a penny under $125.",4,4
730,0,I suppose I could do that if you are willing to deliver the iPad.,6,6
731,0,"okay, I can do that.",0,0
732,0,Hi. I am interested in the apartment you have listed. Can you give me a little more information about it?,5,5
733,0,Well its a great place well designed and well lit,0,0
734,0,Are there any swimming pools? Any utilities included in the monthly price? How new is the unit?,5,5
735,0,No pools but we have a fitness center and we are close to a lot of entertainment venues. We have a pet spa and a fire pit for get together and of course the maintenance of all these amenities is included in the price,0,0
736,0,Is there any utilities included? How new is the unit? These were not answered in your above answer.,5,1
737,0,No utilities and the unit is only in its 5 th year however all appliances are upgrades and so are the fixtures so I can promise a fairly low utility bill in relation to your utility usage,0,0
738,0,"The monthly price is a bit steep, are you able to negotiate?",4,4
739,0,You know what normally i would say no but im gonna go talk to my manager and see what he say give me a few,4,0
740,0,"Okay, thank you so much.",0,0
741,0,Oh my God this never happens my. Manager is willing to waive your application fee and take ten dollars off your monthly rent with the first month free meaning you'll only have to pay 936 per month I swear this never happens and I have no idea what's gotten into him.,0,6
742,0,"While that is a great deal, is there anyway he would go to $800 a month with all the above terms. I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.",7,7
743,0,I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off. I think with his current mood  i could get him to 926 and throw in a key to the gym,6,6
744,0,Do you think that you could talk him into $850?,4,4
745,0,no and.  I dont want to bother him too much or else his mood may go bad,4,0
746,0,"Awe, that is still pretty steep.",4,4
747,0,Give me another few mins ill grill him a little more,0,4
748,0,"Okay, thank you. I really hope you can get him down more. Like I said, I would be a long term renter and I pay on time every month.",4,0
749,0,ok so I spoke to him and he got a little annoyed but that may have worked in your favor he said 900 and that's it final offer,3,3
750,0,"Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?",6,5
751,0,Why of course and i promise as soon as you move in you will see the value of the place,0,0
752,0,"Okay, you got yourself a deal.",0,0
753,0,Hello,0,0
754,0,Hello!,0,0
755,0,You looking to but,0,0
756,0,The bike looks great. Do you know how new the tires are?,5,5
757,0,I replaced them about a year ago.,0,0
758,0,Do you know how many miles are on them?,5,5
759,0,They just sat there. I'd guess 10-20 at the most.,0,3
760,0,Hmmm...Just sitting there isn't good for a bike. That makese me a bit nervous. I'm happy to offer $150 for this without any new tires on them.,4,2
761,0,"That's too low for me, how about $180?",4,4
762,0,$180 is a bit high for me but I could settle at $175 in as-is condition,4,4
763,0,"That'd work, better than having it just sit and riot.",0,0
764,0,"HI, I was interested in the apartment",0,0
765,0,"excellent it has 2 rooms and 1 and a half bathrooms. got everything stove, refrigerator dishwasher and garbage disposal",0,0
766,0,is it furnished?,5,5
767,0,Hello?,0,0
768,0,yes it is furnished,0,0
769,0,"Oh, okay, Nice :-)",0,0
770,0,the rent is 1800,0,0
771,0,"well, I wasn't looking for something quite that high, could it be closer to 1700?",4,4
772,0,1800 is final but look at it this way. I will pay for the water. so no water bill for you. this is a lot of savings for you,6,6
773,0,"true, its good not to have that bill,but I wasnt looking to spend that much a month, is there no way to lower the monthly a little?",4,4
774,0,"did i mention your laudry is on site? haha very well 1700$ is fine. do remember that no animals, or smoking is allowed. no exceptions",6,0
775,0,"Clean clothes is a good thing ;-) I understand the rules, they make sense! Thank you, I will take the place for 1700",0,0
776,0,excellent,0,0
777,0,hello. oscilloscope for sale here.,0,0
778,0,Hi would you take 320?,4,4
779,0,NO that's way too low,4,4
780,0,how abour 330?,4,4
781,0,that's just 10 bucks above your last offer. no.,4,3
782,0,331?,4,4
783,0,um... no. tell you what. i'll let you have it for... 450,4,4
784,0,oh... thank you max budget was 349 :(,7,0
785,0,ah fair enough. maybe look elsewhere. good luck,4,0
786,0,ok good selling it for that price,0,0
787,0,Hello,0,0
788,0,Hello,0,0
789,0,Are you open to negotiation on the Altima?,0,0
790,0,"Yes, I am. It is a great car and very well maintained. I can get you service records if needed",0,0
791,0,"That all sounds great, but unfortunately I just lost my job. I can't pay full price for a car, but I do really need one to get to interviews to try to get a new job.",7,7
792,0,That is an unfortunate situation. What are you able to do?,4,0
793,0,"I know it's kind of low, but would you be able to take $4000, considering my situation?",7,4
794,0,"I'd love to help you out, but I can't go that low. How about 6000",4,4
795,0,6000 is unfortunately still too high for me. Could we meet in the middle at 5000?,4,4
796,0,"Man I'd love to, but that's cutting a lot off of what I need out of this. How about 5500",4,7
797,0,$5500 is acceptable. Thanks!,0,0
798,0,"Hey, is this car still available?",0,0
799,0,"Yes, it is!",0,0
800,0,Was this serviced at BMW and do you have the service records?,5,5
801,0,I have all the service records and they are all up to date.,0,0
802,0,"Perfect!  I do have to admit, I am a little concerned by the additional work though.  While it's appealing, I'm concerned about how it might affect the reliability.",1,0
803,0,I can guarantee that I have driven this car for about a year now and haven't had a single issue with it- the car runs perfectly and I have not had to conduct any repairs.,2,0
804,0,"Ok, that's good.  I feel that 45,000 is a bit high though.  Of course, I do understand that it is a 2016 and has industry standard mileage.  Would you consider coming down on the price some?",4,2
805,0,"The lowest I'm willing to drop it is 42,500. I've done some serious work to this car.",4,3
806,0,"Fair, but I go get a 2017 from a dealer for a little more than you're asking.  If I pick up the car and handle all of the paperwork would you consider 38000?",6,6
807,0,"38,000 just seems too low to me. I could do 41000 as long as you pay in cash, as well as picking up the car and taking care of all the paperwork yourself",6,6
808,0,"I can do 40,000 cash, pick up and paperwork, but I'd expect the remainder of BMW's factory warranty to be transferred too.  Can we call that a deal?",6,6
809,0,Sounds good to me!,0,0
810,0,"Perfect, thanks!",0,0
811,0,Hi there! Is your vehicle still available?,0,0
812,0,"Yes, this absolutely gorgeous BMW is still available, but I'm certain it won't be for long!",0,0
813,0,Great! Is all of the paperwork up to date?,5,5
814,0,All paperwork is up to date and I have clean title in hand.,0,0
815,0,Sounds good. Would you be willing to pay for a background check if I make you an acceptable offer>,6,6
816,0,I have a Carfax report for it in my possession if that is what you are speaking of.,0,0
817,0,"Yes, that's right. I recently saw a similar model at a dealership for about 30,000 but yours looks better maintained, so I'm happy to make a higher offer for your car. How does 31,500 sound?",4,6
818,0,"According to Kelly Blue Book value, I have this car priced very close to the value.  Given the pristine condition, year, miles, etc. $31,500 is very low.  I will accept $43,000.  Even at this price, you are getting an awesome deal!",2,2
819,0,"What if I pick up the car myself? Could you do 35,000?",6,6
820,0,"Sorry, can't do it.",3,0
821,0,"I'm sorry, it sounds like our budgets are just too far apart. Good luck with your sale!",0,0
822,0,Hi are you interested in the house?,0,0
823,0,Yes I'm interested. Can you tell me more about it? What is the square footage of the place and how many bed/bath?,5,5
824,0,It's about 2000 square feet and it has three rooms and two bathrooms.,0,0
825,0,Does it have freeway access?,5,5
826,0,Yes it is actually very close to freeway access.,0,0
827,0,"Great! My only issue then is with the pricing, are you open to negotiate or no?",4,0
828,0,I am open to some negotiating.,0,0
829,0,"Okay well I was thinking because of the location which isn't the best in town, how about we do 1500?",4,2
830,0,"$1,500 would be outrageously low and I cannot accept that offer. Can you come closer to 3000?",4,7
831,0,I'll do 2500 if utilities and internet are included in that monthly price and you waive the deposit.,6,6
832,0,"We cannot waive the deposit but $2,500 utilities included and we can make a deal today.",6,6
833,0,"Okay that would actually work for me, thanks!",0,0
834,0,Are you looking to rent my apartment?,0,0
835,0,"Wow, this looks like a great place!!",0,0
836,0,I was thinking $1725 because it is two bedroom and in a convenient area for commuting,0,2

1110,0,It looks like something I would like to take a look at. The price is a bit high for me. I was thinking of paying $1500.,0,7
1111,0,That's half of what I am asking. Sorry its too low. You need to put some more because you're getting a wonderful unit.,0,4
1112,0,"Are you willing to come down on the price? Is there parking available or free wifi and satellite? With all amenities and utilities, there is no way I can go $3000.",0,2
1113,0,I can give it to you for $2200.,0,4
1114,0,I can do that. I can't wait to see it.,0,0

1141,0,I was looking for something in the 1500-1600 range,4,0
1142,0,"That is really unreasonable considering all the immenities and other going rates, you would need to come up to at least 3000",2,2
1143,0,"I have seen some 2 bedrooms for that price, which I could split the cost with a roommate, so even with amenities, this may be out of my range",2,7
1144,0,it may be then... the absolute lowest i will go is 2700. that is my final offer.,3,3
1145,0,"Ok, I think the most I could spend on this is 2000 - we are a ways apart",3,7
1146,0,ya that is far too low like i said 2700,3,3

1186,0,"Yes, for our purposes. Sure.",0,0
1187,0,I would like to make an offer.  The color isn't what I was interested and I really would prefer a foot versus hand brake for safety.  Do you have any flexiblility on your price?,1,6
1188,0,"Please do make an offer. I have some flexibility, but not much.",0,0
1189,0,Hey there how are you?,0,0
1190,0,"I'm fine, thank you.",0,0
1191,0,"I see you have that nice sub box, how low are you willing to go on it?",4,4
1192,0,"Well, when you consider the fine crafstmanship, and the fact that it will universally fit in some vehicles, I think $50 is a steal.",0,0
1193,0,That's definitely a good price. My problem is I have only $30 bucks and don't get paid until friday and my friend's birthday is tomorrow.,7,7
1194,0,"Well, that's okay, I can take credit cards through my online store ;)",2,0
1195,0,I can do you one better. I have 5 lbs of gummy bears that have been sealed since I bought them. How about I literally sweeten the deal by giving you all 5 lbs of gummy bears and 30 bucks?,6,6
1196,0,"Well I'm sure that would appeal to some sellers, but unfortunately I'm an end stage diabetic, which is why I have to sell my sub box, so I couldn't eat any sugar :(",7,7
1197,0,"Oh no worries, I have 3 lbs of sugar free gummy bears! Great for diabetics and being constipated! How about I pick that sub box up and drop off the 30 bucks with your sugar free colon cleansers...er...gummy bears?",6,6

1204,0,Not often as I traveled a lot. It is in good condition.,0,0
1205,0,any stains....how is this thing going to look under a black light?,1,5
1206,0,No stains at all. I had a mattress cover on for the time I had it. I imagine it would look fine under a black light but I never had one.,0,0
1207,0,I've got $170 cash and I'll come pick it up today,6,6
1208,0,Could you do $190?,4,4

1212,0,Is this a month to month or lease period?,5,5
1213,0,"I can do month to month if that's better for you, but I prefer a lease of either 6 months or 1 year.",0,6
1214,0,I've heard this is the area of the Bay city bomber.  Is the area safe?,5,5
1215,0,"Although that incident was very tragic, the area is generally very safe and has a low crime rate.",0,0
1216,0,Are you willing to negotiate the price?  I'm concerned about copycats and would be a little uncomfortable.,4,4
1217,0,Of course. Give me an offer.,0,0

1219,0,I like it to be more around 1350.,4,4

1224,0,"very well kept and only has 32k miles very clean interior and drives like a champ, i'm pretty firm on price but could also be flirted with a great deal",0,0
1225,0,Does it still have any warranties on it?,5,5
1226,0,"i have a warranty for the tires, i'll make a lower offer of 11000",0,6
1227,0,I want the car but I want to be able to get it at a lower price. I do not want to offend you but can you do $9000,4,4

1238,0,Water trash and parking included as well as acess to the pool and tennis court.,0,0
1239,0,Perfect. Would you be willing to drop the price to $2500?,4,4
1240,0,"$3800 is already with 20% student discount, I can only drop to $3500.",2,6
1241,0,"Since there are so many perks and the room sizes are huge, I would be willing to pay $3500.",0,2

1247,0,"Yes it works great, almost new. Only has 50 miles on it.",0,0
1248,0,That's great. I just have a tight budget this month and need a new bike to get to work. Can you go any lower on the price?,7,7
1249,0,I can negotiate a little. What did you have in mind?,0,0
1250,0,I was hoping for 900$ that leaves me a little breathing room in the budget. Just need a good sturdy bike to get to work.,7,7

1252,0,That would be super!,0,0

1254,0,"Sounds good! I'm aware that the listing says $95, but I'm willing to negotiate.",0,0
1255,0,"That's good to know. Before that, the listing mentions its from IKEA. Does it have any scratches or marks? since its black in color and I am buying it for my new house. So, I would like it to look like new and not used.",1,1
1256,0,"It does have some minor scratches. Not too noticeable unless you look really, really closely. For that, I'm willing to bring the price down a bit.",0,0
1257,0,"I see. Okay, I am willing to pay $87 for it. Does it sound good to you?",4,4
1258,0,"I was hoping not to go too low. For right now, the lowest I will go is $90.",3,4

1265,0,"Sure thing. Frame is 17 Inches. Comes with a 3-speed Shimano nexus shifter. It works fine, but a tune-up and some new tires would help its performance greatly.",0,0
1266,0,"Woah, that sounds like it needs a lot of stuff. What kind of condition is it in?",5,5
1267,0,"Again, it's in great working condition. It doesn't need those things that I mentioned, but they would help.",0,0

1269,0,Sure. That won't be a problem. Will you be willing to pay the listed price for it?,0,6
1270,0,"Absolutely not, I'm thinking more $40. It needs another $100 in work.",2,2

1290,0,"No there isn't, she's an older gal.",0,0
1291,0,Would you do fifty?,4,4
1292,0,"I was planning on selling it for around $150, used to ride a lot and kept the bike well maintained. New job and everything so haven't really had the chance to ride anymore. Since the chain guard is missing I'd be happy to go down to $100",2,0
1293,0,"It would be just parts for me, $50 is all it is worth to me.",2,7
1294,0,Eh afraid I can't do that. If you'd come pick it up I'd do $75 to save myself the hassle,6,6
1295,0,"OK, I can pick it up. $75.00",0,6
1296,0,Hi I am interested in the bike,0,0

1304,0,$2300 would be a great price point for me.,4,4
1305,0,I don't think I can go that low. The bike still has 2 years full warranty left on it. I could probably do $2500 if you picked it up,2,6
1306,0,I could do 2500 but only if you include the pedals.,6,6
1307,0,"Yes, it includes a spare set of pedals. You have a deal",0,0
1308,0,It's a nice drone in a perfect condition. make an offer.,0,0
1309,0,"Hello, I would like to pay $400. Would that work for you?",4,4
1310,0,"nope. That's way too low, man. At most, i could probably knock off a hundred off the price. so 650. But really that's the most I can do",3,3
1311,0,"Are there other offers currently? I have seen a similar product available for $500, but it's farther away so I wanted to make a deal",2,0
1312,0,"There are a plenty of other drones for that price. some will be new too, but they won't be DJI phatom 4. You're paying for quality here my friend.",2,0
1313,0,$500 is the highest I can go,3,3
1314,0,"tell you what. 600, and you have your drone. a perfect condition. phantom 4.  deal?",3,6
1315,0,"Unfortunately I do not have enough available for that, I could round up some cash to hit $535?",7,7
1316,0,I can't do that. Sorry. 600 really is the lowest. Maybe this drone isn't for you,3,3
1317,0,"Yeah I will look elsewhere, thanks for your time",0,0
1318,0,no problem good luck,0,0
1319,0,Good morning,0,0
1320,0,Hi there. Nice bike. How many miles are on it?,5,5
1321,0,Just under 100.  The odometer I bought with it shows 97.,0,2
1322,0,Okay. Does it work well?,1,5
1323,0,"Yes, there are no issues with the bike and it has always been kept in the garage when it isn't being ridden.",0,0
1324,0,Great. That's good to know. I'm interested but 350 is a pretty steep price for a bike that's over 20 years old.,2,2
1325,0,"Ok, well, it is in great condition, but I am willing to bargain",2,0
1326,0,Okay. I can take it off your hands today for 300. I can pick it up myself.,6,6
1327,0,I think $300 is completely reasonable.,0,0
1328,0,Awesome. I'll email you with the time,0,0
1329,0,Hello! The table is beautiful but a bit far from my location. I'd be happy to pay full price if you would be willing to deliver.,6,6
1330,0,"Hi, I had asked for a phone number in reply but since you are here now we can chat this way instead.",0,0
1331,0,Sounds good. Do you think you would be able to deliver?,0,6
1332,0,That depends how far you are exactly? are we talking 20 miles or how far?,0,5
1333,0,Based on the Google maps I am approximately 17.3 miles out.,0,0
1334,0,"Alright, it is not too far but I have another offer now, for someone to come pick it up like I had specified in the ad",0,6
1335,0,Well darn. I really love the table but it just won't fit in my smartcar. I swear those cars just aren't so smart after all. :-(,7,1
1336,0,Ha that is funny.. sorry I really wanted cash and pick up. Do you have friend who has abigger car?,3,6
1337,0,No. But I would be happy to throw in a 12 pack of beer that I have here at the house to make up the difference. It's Alaska White. Have you had it? It's fantabulous!,6,6

1347,0,"I can't go that low, but how about $3300.  I can include videos of the Russian team and a COA.",6,6
1348,0,"That is a little high, could you deliver?",6,6
1349,0,I will be happy to deliver to you.,0,0
1350,0,okay let's make a deal then..,0,0

1355,0,How much life do the batteries have left?,5,5
1356,0,"The full life, I've not used them more than twice. I just didn't like them.",0,0
1357,0,What didn't you like about the batteries are they no good?,1,1
1358,0,"No, they're awesome! I just don't have a lot of time to fly the drone and not a lot of interest in it.",0,7
1359,0,Oh okay would you take $120 for them?,4,4
1360,0,"Yes, that works fine for me",0,0

1363,0,Would you accept $25?  I think this is the average price for phone unlocking.,2,4

1365,0,Hi.  can you unlock my iphone?,0,0
1366,0,I sure can. My price is $50 a phone.,0,0
1367,0,"$25 is my budget for this, but what are the perks for $50?",4,7
1368,0,"I really cant do much for $25, But if you'd like, I can include a new case for it as well.",6,6
1369,0,That would be perfect.  I need a new case.,0,0
1370,0,Good deal.,0,0
1371,0,Hi is the bike still available?,0,0
1372,0,"Hi, are you interested in this bike? Yes, it is still available.",0,0
