604,0,"$595 is a little high for my budget. Are there any accessories you'd be willing to throw in--for instance, a basket, lights, and/or bike pump? That would make it a lot more appealing for me.",6,6
605,0,"I will throw in my 700c wheelset, instead of the standard wheelset. How about that!",6,6
606,0,"I am excited for the 700c wheelset, but it looks like that was already listed in the ad. Is there anything else you can include?",5,5
607,0,Nothing unfortunately. How about 550 and we can call it a night!,4,4
608,0,"That sounds pretty reasonable. Before we make the final agreement, could you just let me know roughly how may miles are on the bike?",5,5
609,0,Well I bought the bike from someone else and have not used it. He did not specify on the miles but just said that it was very low!,0,0
610,0,"Hmm--the ad says that you bought it new. Since you actually bought it (lightly) used from someone else, can we lower the price to $450?",2,2
611,0,Sounds good!,0,0
612,0,HI!,0,0
613,0,"Hi, is this used or new?",5,5

617,0,I was hoping for $190.,4,4
618,0,"I don't think I can go that low, sorry.  I would like to help you out though.  How about $215.00?",4,4
619,0,do you have case you could throw in?,6,6

627,0,I saw that any chance you would come down in price?,0,0
628,0,I could come down to $2150 but that price is very firm.,4,4
629,0,"I was hoping to pay $1750, any perks you can offer ?",6,6
630,0,At $2150 I could offer a year warranty/insurance for the apartment and one month paid utilities.,6,6

637,0,"$30 per pet, and they have to be fixed. 5 max pets per lease.",0,0
638,0,"ok, I just have a cat.",0,0
639,0,That'd be fine. We ask for $2311 a month.,0,0
640,0,any chance you could do it for 1800? I only need one parking space.,2,2
641,0,"I wish, but for some reason you want to live in California near the bay. Everything's way more expensive here. We offer 2 pools, so you can urinate in one and move to the next.",2,2
642,0,"Well you must be very busy , your response time is very slow.  I am willing to come up to $2000.",1,1
643,0,"Sorry, that must be the service. Can you do $2200 and I'll give you a month free.",6,6

650,0,"I would come up to $2,750",4,4
651,0,Sorry that is just way to low.,3,3
652,0,"My last and final offer would be $3,000. That is more than fair for a vehicle that is almost 15 years old.",2,2
653,0,It is a one owner and I have all the maintenance records. I could go $3800,2,2
654,0,"3,000 is my final offer",3,3
655,0,I can't go that low. Sorry,4,4
656,0,"Hey so I have a great phone for sale, it's in excellent condition.",0,0
657,0,"Hi, I am interested in a phone, are they brand new or used?",5,5
658,0,"It's brand new, I didn't need them. They're $650 each, this is a steal especially since it's $150 off.",0,0
659,0,I am a student and would want to work on the price.. is that an option?,7,7
660,0,"I don't know about that. Do you have a family member or friend who might want one, the price goes down in multiples.",6,6
661,0,I could maybe get my sister in on a deal but it would have to be a great deal.,0,0
662,0,They would get knocked down to $600 each. I could also include two cases and glass screen protectors.,6,6
663,0,"Wow, still too high, i was thinking, 380 each.",4,4
664,0,"I can't go that low, the lowest I could go is $575. That's only if you buy 2.",3,3

719,0,No thankfully she did not!,0,0
720,0,"Excellent! If you don't mind me asking, how much did you originally pay for it?",5,5
721,0,I had originally got it for $200 but I am now selling it for half the price,0,0
722,0,"I see.  I like the bike. It seems like a good deal, but I am very hesitant to pay $100 for it when it is a year old.  Is there any wiggle room on that price?",2,2
723,0,I could bring it down to $90 that's about it because its not very old.,2,2
724,0,"$90 pretty good, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80.  Maybe we can meet in the middle at $85?",4,4
725,0,I can do $90 and that's about it,3,3
726,0,You drive a hard bargain.  Are you getting a lot of offers for it?,0,0
727,0,Yes I am. But I am willing to give it to you for $90. Are you interested?,0,0

742,0,Looks great!  Would you be willing to take $10000 if I come see it?,4,4
743,0,Oh my!  10K is way lower than I would think about.  This car is in great working order- it's been well taken care of.  I have to stick with my original offer,2,2

745,0,I'm sorry.  That,4,4
746,0,What is the lowest you'll take?,0,0
747,0,The lowest I would consider is $16000.,3,3

749,0,"I can go down to $15000.  But, that is way lower than what I was willing to do originally.",4,4
750,0,"How about we settle at $14,000.  You'll have cash in hand and I'll have a new car.",4,4
751,0,$14500 and you have a deal.,3,3
752,0,OK.  I'm sure I'll be happy with it.  Deal.,0,0
753,0,What all does the phone already have on it?,5,5
754,0,The phone is completely erased with no leftover data from the previous user.,0,0
755,0,I was hoping for music or something. Do you have the manual>,5,5
756,0,"There is a manual and there is iTunes leftover credit for $12, so you can buy some music with that.",0,0
757,0,Is the screen like new?,1,1
758,0,"Yes! No scratches. It currently has a screen protector on it, which you can chose to keep on or take off.",0,0
759,0,I could offer $230.00,4,4
760,0,I would sell for $300.,4,4
761,0,$250?,4,4
762,0,$280 with headphones.,6,6
763,0,I could do $255 with the headphones.,6,6
764,0,I would do $265 without the headphones or $280 with headphones.,4,4
765,0,I'll meet you half way at $260 with the headphones.,4,4
766,0,Sure.,0,0
767,0,Hi!  I am interested in your bike.  How long have you had it?,5,5
768,0,I'm glad you're interested. We've only had it for about 6 months. It only has about 50 miles on it!,0,0
769,0,"That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try.",7,7
770,0,"Well my wife has definitely enjoyed it, so if yours is like mine I'm sure she will too! I've listed this at $1100 and I expect it to go quickly.",0,0
771,0,"I won't argue that it is a decent price.  Just wondering, is there anything wrong with it?  Seems like a lot to spend on a bike that only has 50 miles of usage...",1,1
772,0,I'm not aware of anything wrong with it - unless you count the fact that it's taking up space in my garage that I'd like to use for other things!,0,0
773,0,"Well, I would love to take it off of your hands at $800.  I'll throw in a birthday party invite. lol",6,6
774,0,"If you can make it $900 and pick it up today, I think we can make a deal",6,6
775,0,$900.  I think we have a deal!,0,0
776,0,Fantastic!,0,0
777,0,"Hi, can you tell me more about the condition of the iPhones?",5,5
778,0,"Both are like new.  My parents who are retired used them for about 6-7, with less than 10 hours of talk time.",0,0
779,0,"What does it mean they used them ""for about 6-7""?",5,5
780,0,"oops!  sorry, it's late and I'm trying hard to get these phones sold.  I meant to say they used them for about 6-7 months.",0,0
781,0,"Ok. Well, I think that those phones probably got a good amount of use in 6-7 months. So, would you be willing to accept a price of $75?",2,2
782,0,"No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone.",2,2
783,0,"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",6,6
784,0,I think we can do that since you're local.  190 for both phones and I will deliver.  How's tomorrow afternoon?,0,0
785,0,sounds good,0,0
786,0,Great!  I hope you enjoy your new phones.,0,0
787,0,Hi,0,0
788,0,"Hello, what condition is you bike mount in?",5,5
789,0,"It has only been used a few times, so in really great condition still.",0,0
790,0,That sounds good. How long have you had it?,5,5
791,0,I have had it just over seven months.,0,0
792,0,Okay. That's not too long. I'd like to buy it from you for $7 since it has been used.,2,2
793,0,that is less than half of asking...,4,4
794,0,"I realize that but I'm site unseen. For a used object, I think that is fair.",2,2
795,0,"Well I really do want to make a deal with you , but you need to come up a little in theprice, it is almost brand new.",2,2
796,0,The best I can do is $9 if you're willing to hold it for me for 2 days while I wait for my paycheck.,6,6
797,0,I suppose I could do that. 9 sounds fair enough,0,0
798,0,Awesome. Then $9 it is. It was great doing business with you.,0,0
799,0,hello,0,0
800,0,"Hello, are you interested in buying this vehicle?",0,0
801,0,"yes indeed, I like the color too",0,0

803,0,"yeah thats the problem, I ve been checking my cash and I don't have that much",7,7
804,0,"Well that's okay, I take credit too :)",0,0
805,0,"yeah I have a problem with that too, I already maxed out, so let's try and find a solution, how about 9 large",4,4
806,0,"Friend, check out the description of this fine automobile that I posted. It's got a new radiator, fresh tires, I mean, the list goes on!",2,2
807,0,"but friend it's 8 years old, so what about 9850, i think it's fair and I will take care of the delivery charges",2,2
808,0,"Okay, I think that is a fair deal.",0,0
809,0,ok I guess we could write one more line so we don't get rejected,0,0
810,0,I'm not sure what you could possibly be referring to?,0,0
811,0,"because sometime the computers could find out it's was done too quickly and might refuse this , and we have to do it again , you will see in futur tasks",0,0
812,0,"Hello, I am interested in your Chevy. I see that you are asking $5,000, is the price negotiable?",0,0
813,0,I have a little wiggle room.,0,0
814,0,Is there any body damage?,1,1
815,0,"No, it is in really good shape.",0,0
816,0,"I have looked at comps and I am willing to pay $3,000",2,2
817,0,"I couldn't go that low, I would drop the price to $4,500 for you",0,0
818,0,"It just doesn't appear to be worth $4,500. Would you be willing to take $3,500",4,4
819,0,"I assure you that this is a nice vehicle and is worth the money. I am needing cash so I would go down to $4,000",2,2
820,0,"I only have $3,800 but I have it in cash and can be there in a couple hours.",6,6
821,0,"$3,800 if you are here in a couple hours with cash.",0,0
822,0,I am interested in your bike. Is there anything wrong with it?,1,1
823,0,It does need new handlebar tape and maybe tires.,0,0
824,0,"Okay, is the price negotiable?",0,0
825,0,"A little, make me an offer.",4,4
826,0,"I have looked up what this bike is worth and taken into account the new handlebar tape and tires and I would feel comfortable paying $700, would that work.",2,2
827,0,"That is a little low, I understand it needs some things. I would drop the priced to $1,000.",4,4
828,0,"I just can't pay that much, it isn't worth it. How about $775?",2,2
829,0,If you can pick it up today and pay cash I would take $850.,6,6
830,0,"I just checked and I have $836 cash, if I am there today and pay cash would you take that?",6,6

861,0,"I'm sure you already saw in the ad, but the bars are $30, and are unused. Did you have any questions?",0,0
862,0,I do. Is the original boxes and paperwork with them? Is there a warranty with the parts that will be transferred to me if I purchase them?,5,5
863,0,"Everything that came in the box with them is there, I put it all back in after I realized I wouldn't be able to use them on my bike. Unfortunately the warranty for them is outdated by now, they're in new condition, but they've been sitting for a while.",0,0
864,0,"I am interested in them. However, since the warranty is outdated now, would you be willing to come down on the price?",2,2
865,0,"I am willing to negotiate the price a little lower, that isn't a problem.",0,0
866,0,"If I agree to pick them up, would you be willing to do $22 considering there is no warranty and they have been sitting for awhile.",2,2
867,0,"$22 is a little bit low for me, but I could definitely come down in price if you do pick them up. How about we meet halfway at $25?",6,6
868,0,"Well, it is a bit of a drive for me. I'm sure you want to get rid of these, could you do $23?",6,6
869,0,I suppose that would be about the price it'd cost to ship them out. You've got yourself a deal bud.,0,0
870,0,Thank you.,0,0
871,0,Are you interested in  My galaxy,0,0
872,0,"Yes, it looks like a great phone.  Can you tell me a little about its history?",5,5
873,0,I've had it for 6 months. It comes unlocked. The network is at@t,0,0
874,0,"So, it should work on any network that requires a SIM card, then, correct?  T-mobile for example?",5,5
875,0,Yes that is correct. I am selling it at 397 but am willing to negotiate price,0,0
876,0,"OK, it appears that the face is scratch-free and crack-free, is that correct?  How is the back?",5,5
877,0,Yes it is scratch free. It also comes with a screen protector I put on,0,0
878,0,"Very nice.  I'm wondering if I might be able to pick it up directly from you, rather than having it shipped?",6,6
879,0,Sounds good to me. What are you willing to pay,0,0
880,0,This looks like a great phone.  Would you be willing to accept $320 for it?,4,4
881,0,Yes deal,0,0
882,0,What is the lowest price you are willing to accept?,0,0
883,0,How old is this sofa,5,5
884,0,"I don't remember exactly, but I think I bought it about 5 years ago.",0,0
885,0,What is the color?,5,5
886,0,It's light grey... In a dark room it looks as if it's almost white.,0,0
887,0,Okay. In your ad you stated you had it only for a year but now you say you think you bought it about 5 years ago. Which is correct?,1,1
888,0,"Originally I had bought it for my son for his apartment. However, he's got married and I needed a new sofa for my man cave. So he gave it to me. My wife wants to turn my man cave into a sewing room so I have to sell it.",0,0
889,0,"Okay so it has been used by two different people then? I am interested in the sofa, however, the price you are asking is a bit steep for a sofa that is 5 years old and used by two different people. Are you willing to negotiate on the price?",2,2
890,0,Understood... How about if I lower it to $300 and I'll even deliver it to you myself.,6,6
891,0,"If you could go to $200, I would come and get it today with cash in hand.",6,6
892,0,That's a little lower than I wanted to get for it. How about $260 and I'll deliver it.,6,6
893,0,Can you do $220 with me picking it up? It is 5 years old.,6,6
894,0,Deal.,0,0
895,0,"Hey, you're interested n the bike?",0,0
896,0,Is it clean?,1,1
897,0,"Yeah, I serviced it and cleaned it to be ready for you to use it",0,0
898,0,Would it fit in my Toyata Corolla or should I bring my Suv to pick it up?,5,5
899,0,"oh, yeah it's 29 inches, I'll drop it off at your house with my truck. Definitely would not fit inside Corolla sorry",6,6
900,0,"Ok, I am really was looking at $1819. What do you think?",4,4
901,0,2200,4,4
902,0,"Sounds fair,since you are dropping it off, so we got a deal!",0,0
903,0,"Oh, thank you for being so obliging, tomorrow evening?",0,0
904,0,Sounds good. thanks,0,0
905,0,"Hello there, interested?",0,0
906,0,I am but the price is a little too high,4,4
907,0,$380 is very reasonable for the market value.,2,2
908,0,Is the item new or used?,5,5
909,0,They are brand new in box still.,0,0
910,0,I'm really interested in paying 190,4,4
911,0,"That is really far too low, these are top of the line binoculars. They are the most advanced out today.",1,2
912,0,Are there any extras you could throw in if I paid the full price?,6,6
913,0,I could offer free shipping and a 5 year warranty.,6,6
914,0,That would help alot but I'm still debating how much I want to pay for it.  I would be willing to go 250,4,4
915,0,I think the lowest I cou0dl do is 350.,4,4
916,0,I would be willing to go for three hundred with the warranty and the free shipping,6,6
917,0,sorry typo there could do. Like I said 350 is really the lowest I can do without taking a big loss myself.,3,3
918,0,How about 325 with free shipping and the warranty,4,4
919,0,"sorry 350 is my lowest , I am firm on that. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.",3,3
920,0,"I will pay 350 with the warranty, free shipping and insurance on the item.",6,6
921,0,Okay deal.,0,0
922,0,"Hey there, you're interested in one of these cell phone batteries?",0,0
923,0,"Hello, are these batteries used?",5,5
924,0,"Nope, I couldn't sell them if they were used, we're a third-party distributor of excess batteries.",0,0
925,0,Okay and how many batteries are you selling for $10?,5,5
926,0,"Oh, it's 1 for 10, but if you want multiple we can sell at a discount for bulk",6,6
927,0,"Thanks but I only need the one battery. And since this is an older model, would you accept $5 for it?",2,2
928,0,"No, we need 8 to at least break even",4,4
929,0,If I pay $8 can you throw in a phone case?,6,6
930,0,"Oh, yes I have a spare right here.",0,0
931,0,That sounds good. I'll take it for $8,0,0
932,0,"Hi, you're interested in the Cx-9?",0,0
933,0,"Yes, I am. Has it been in any accidents?",1,1
934,0,"It's been in a couple minor accidents, but I can assure you that it only resulted in cosmetic damage. I still have the recipts from the body shop to show what was replaced.",0,0
935,0,"Well the interior looks nice from the picture but what color is it? Also, did you smoke in it?",1,1
936,0,It's a light silver color. Smoke has never entered this beauty.,0,0
937,0,"I agree, it is a beauty but it does have a lot of miles and is over 10 years old so $8800 is too much for me. How would you feel about $6500?",2,2
938,0,"I have another buyer willing to pay $7000 at the moment. If you could beat that price, we may have a deal.",2,2
939,0,I'm going to pull a price is right move. Would you take $7001 in cash today?,6,6
940,0,"I was hoping to at least hit the $7500 mark, but that move was witty enough for me to agree to it! You made my day, honestly.",0,0
941,0,Awesome. It's a deal.,0,0

948,0,I can let it go at $800 right this minute,4,4
949,0,will 750 be a good middle ground then? I will pick it up as soon as possible. in the next 24 hours.,6,6
950,0,"I'll tell you what, you can have it for $800 and I'll offer you half a year to return it for a full refund, so long as it is not terribly damaged or beaten up",6,6
951,0,very well then this will work,0,0

953,0,I do. Are you interested in buying it?,0,0
954,0,Yes I'm interested but I have a couple questions. What condition is it in?,5,5
955,0,It is actually in great condition.,0,0
956,0,Okay but are there any signs of wear and tear? Scratches? stuff like that,1,1
957,0,There is only one small scratch on the back of it near the bottom.,0,0

967,0,How much would you like for it?,0,0
968,0,I'm asking 30 for it :),4,4
969,0,"I can come pick it up, but with gas, etc... it would be pushing the envelope to make it worth my while....I was looking to spend a max of $20....must be an heirloom this credenza, eh?",2,2
970,0,Yes it's a pretty rare piece too. I can do 25 if that helps you but that's going to be my limit.,2,2
971,0,"Definitely feel for you there on the family legacy item.  Listen, if you'll go $23.50, I'll come up myself, get it off your hands, and get you a beer...",6,6

984,0,100,4,4
985,0,ok... that's lower than i want. remember this bed doesn't need a box srping because of the frame. it's a neat bed. hard to find a bed like that,2,2
986,0,95,4,4
987,0,that's not really the direction you should be going. i've listed it for 150 which is already a steal.,2,2
988,0,"sorry bout that, my finger slipped",0,0
989,0,"no problem. at 150, it's already a steal. rare hard to find bed like this? for 150? good deal, man",2,2
990,0,"ya, i meant 105 for your trouble. sorry bout that. you're right...it's a great deal at 105",4,4
991,0,"105 is still too low, i say we go with 125 split the difference",4,4
992,0,"in accidently put the 0 in front of the 5. But ya, I can do 125 if there is something extra you can offer. Can you meet that?",6,6
993,0,ok i can deliver it for you at 125,6,6
994,0,120 and free delivery and you have a deal,3,3
995,0,that doesn't work.,3,3
996,0,whoa glitchy system,0,0
997,0,"Hi, are you interested in the bike?",0,0
998,0,yes. but it's kinda pricey for a 27 yr old bike.,2,2
999,0,"I know, but this is a collector's bike.  So people generally fix them up and only ride the bike to show off.  It's actually worth quite a bit because it is so old, yet in decent condition.",0,0
1000,0,needing a handbrake isn't in a decent condition. tell you what. i'll give you 100 for it.,2,2
1001,0,How about if I throw in a hand brake and you can install it yourself for $150?,6,6
1002,0,yeah that's not gonna work for me. 110 is the max i'd pay for a bike in this condition,3,3
1003,0,Is there something else I can throw in to sweeten the deal?,0,0
1004,0,"nah. 110, bike and the handbrake. if that's ok we got a deal",3,3

1009,0,It's a great bike. Can I answer any questions for you? It's a great price considering all the extras it has,0,0
1010,0,hello?,0,0
1011,0,Sorry. My son knows alot about this bike. I was wondering if you are willing to lower the price any?,0,0
1012,0,"I put a lot of extras into this bike and it is in great condition. I can go down a little bit, but not too much. I am asking 250, but I can probably do 225",2,2
1013,0,That is exactly what i have saved up. My son is going to be so surprised on his birthday. Thank you.,0,0
1014,0,Sounds great. Can you pick up today?,0,0
1015,0,Can be there in 20 min.,0,0
1016,0,Hello,0,0
1017,0,Hello there. I was wondering if I would be able to stop by and check this house out to see the inside,5,5
1018,0,"Sure, you can come by anytime after 1 pm tomorrow. How much are you hoping to spend on this?",0,0
1019,0,"I am looking to pay around 1350, are you willing to lower the price you are asking?",4,4
1020,0,"Yes, but 1350 seems a bit too much for me to lower it. Does 2300 work for you?",4,4
1021,0,"Well it is fully furnished, right?",5,5
1022,0,Yes it is. It also has Comcast cable with all channels and you get house cleaning twice per month.,2,2
1023,0,Okay that is a lot so I would be good with paying 2300,0,0
1024,0,"Okay. So, do we have a deal?",0,0
1025,0,Yup!,0,0
1026,0,Good doing business with you.,0,0
1027,0,"Hi so I'm interested in buying the bedroom set, are there any scratches?",1,1
1028,0,"No scratches, it's in very good condition",0,0
1029,0,"Great, how much can you reasonably come down to?",0,0
1030,0,Well the item is listed for $350 how much are you looking to spend,4,4
1031,0,"Well a new bedroom set like this I could probably buy from the store for $500, so I'd have to say since it's used it needs to be in the 150 price range.",2,2
1032,0,"Last time I was in the store, a whole bedroom set which included the bed, dresser and two night stands was on sale for $1500 brand new.  I can go as low as 275.00",2,2
1033,0,"I still can't do that, look if you deliver it I can literally go down to $240 no lower.",6,6
1034,0,I can do $240 as long as you're in a 15-mile radius.,6,6
1035,0,I can be there in an hour.,0,0
1036,0,you need to accept the $240 offer,0,0
1037,0,Does it offer bluetooth?,5,5
1038,0,It doesn't i'm sorry,0,0
1039,0,Well that will effect my final price...is it a 2-way speaker?,5,5
1040,0,I'm not sure what you mean by 2-way,0,0
1041,0,It just is something about the sound resonation I think I really do not know the specifics I just know you shpuld make sure any speakers you buy are two way.,5,5
1042,0,Sine I don't know that I will be able to lower the price for you if that helps.,0,0
1043,0,Yes it would...can you tell me what btu it pushes?,5,5
1044,0,Again I'm not sure. This is my sons so I don't know much about it except that he asked if I could sell if for him.,0,0
1045,0,Ok I am going to submit my offer for the speaker directly.,3,3
1046,0,Okay that's good,0,0
1047,0,"Hi, can I have pets?",5,5
1048,0,Does cable come wih it?,5,5
1049,0,"No but water, trash, gas and two side by side underground parking spaces near the elevator are just a few of the amenities the place has to offer.",0,0
1050,0,Would I be able to have a pitbull?,5,5
1051,0,Does it have all its shots? Is it neutered or spayed?,5,5
1052,0,"It has all its shots. I was thinking I will offer $1924,but I am flexible to go higher.",4,4
1053,0,I am sorry I can not let it go for that low...not taking into account a 60lbs dog as well.,2,2
1054,0,Make me an offer,4,4

1059,0,I'm asking $250 but the price is negotiable,0,0
1060,0,OK Thats good to hear. I really like the bike but i think $250 would have been a fair price about 5 years ago :/,2,2
1061,0,"Lol  hey!  vintage is in!!  Ok, since you're being a good sport how does 200 sound?",4,4
1062,0,"its a little bit out of my price range still, I really need the bike to get to my new job. I have $125 to spare but i can walk to pick it up from you if that helps?? We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up",6,6
1063,0,"I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150",4,3
1064,0,I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :),7,7
1065,0,"You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!",7,7
1066,0,"Ahh make me one more compromise, i know im the worst. i can scrounge an extra 15 up, how about 140?",7,7
1067,0,ok you drive a hard bargain.  please remember to pay it forward.  $140 - sold to the whinney person over there!  lol,0,0
1068,0,"You are the best :) Thank you this is super helpful for me, see you soon!",0,0
1069,0,"Hello, are you interested in leasing my apartment?",0,0

1073,0,sorry...that s/h been 565.  This is an excellent apartment complex.  Too many amenities to list but I will guarantee you would find everything you are looking for here.,0,0
1074,0,The price is a little high for me?  Would you be willing to come down?,4,4
1075,0,I understand.  I can come down a little but I will not be able to honor the $500 off move in.  What price range did you have in mind?,0,0
1076,0,"$1500.  Of course, if utilities are covered and there is a gym and a pool, I could go a bit higher.",6,6
1077,0,"Well, we have 2 pools, a beautifully lit tennis court, and fitness center and free wi-fi in the common area.  The apartment has a/c, central heat, private patios or balconies with views of the East Bay hills.  Location is ideal - close to local shopping and dining and easy commute to local business centers and the BART station.  I can accept $2000",2,2
1078,0,You have me convinced.  I will go $2000.,0,0
1079,0,Great.  Can you stop over this evening and sign a lease?,0,0
1080,0,"Hi, are you interested in the phone?",0,0
1081,0,hi i can pay you 120,4,4
1082,0,"That is too low for an unlocked phone in great condition.  I can lower the price to $300, but that is the best I can do.  I need the money from this phone to buy some other things.",7,7
1083,0,I see it is has some condition issues  and it is used  not to mention on the smaller side as far as memory goes,2,2
1084,0,The issue is cosmetic.  I can bring the price down to $275 if that bothers so.  I can also throw in a free headset.  Deal?,6,6
1085,0,i can do 150 thats pretty much the best i can do  275 is still to much,7,7
1086,0,I cannot sell it that low.  Do you have anything else you can give me plus the money to see if we can make a deal?,6,6
1087,0,i can send you an older fitbit  and bring the cash offer up to 175  that is my best and final,6,6

1089,0,I can do 190 and the fitbit you include the headset  and we have a deal,6,6
1090,0,"Hello, I'm am interested in your apartment.",0,0
1091,0,It's a great place!,0,0
1092,0,It looks nice. I am on a budget can we negotiate.,0,0
1093,0,"sure, what did you have in mind?",0,0
1094,0,I would like to spend about $1037.00 for your apartment.,4,4

1096,0,Does your price include water and trash?,5,5
1097,0,"Yea, it does. And central air and heating.",0,0
1098,0,"Oh great, does $1800.00 work for you?",4,4
1099,0,I can do $1950 and offer my patio furniture to go with the apartment?,6,6
1100,0,"Thats great, thank you.",0,0
1101,0,Hi! You were interested in the Ranger?,0,0
1102,0,"It looks nice, but I really don't think it's worth what you're asking.",1,1
1103,0,"How come? It was very well maintained through our company, everything runs perfect on it. Just like new.",0,0
1104,0,It's 6 years old and that mileage seems high. If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time,1,1
1105,0,"The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever.",0,0
1106,0,"I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000",2,2
1107,0,"4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you.",6,6
1108,0,"I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty",6,6
1109,0,"I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back!",6,6
1110,0,"Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer.",3,3
1111,0,"If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount. I'll pend you an offer. Think about it. Thank you for your time either way!",4,4
1112,0,Hi how are you?,0,0
1113,0,"Hello, I'm interested in buying the truck. I have a couple questions. I'm good thank-you and you?",5,5
1114,0,Vey well. How can i help you?,0,0
1115,0,Do you have the title to the truck? Are there other rips on the seats? When was the last time it had a tune up?,5,5
1116,0,Yes i have the title! Not only are there no rips on the seats they are heated as well. The entire interior is beautiful and it was barely driven it only has 68000 miles on it.,0,0
1117,0,Super now is it at all possible to lower the price? It's something I'd like it's just out of my budget.,7,7
1118,0,I would be willing to go to 6000 but no lower. Are you willing to accept that?,4,4
1119,0,"I was thinking more around 4,000.",4,4
1120,0,No for a truck in this condition with this many miles on it it is worth far more than that i will drop to 5800 but no lower.,2,2
1121,0,"Wow, you're sure solid. Is there any way you could go 5500?",4,4
1122,0,Sure,0,0
1123,0,Hi is the table and bench still available?,0,0
1124,0,Yes I still have them for sale here.,0,0
1125,0,Are they in good shape?,5,5
1126,0,Yes it is still in good shape it's very well built and it's very sturdy.,0,0
1127,0,I see you have it listed for $575. Are you willing to come down on the price some?,4,4
1128,0,Sure I can work with you on the price a little bit what did you have in mind?,0,0

1274,0,"40,500 works.",4,4
1275,0,"No it doesn't, I just said my best offer was 41k and you offer less? Can you do better than 41000 or not?",3,3
1276,0,"No, not unless you offer some incentive. Can I have a 500 dollar rebate?",6,6
1277,0,"No there's no rebate I can offer you, why would I offer a rebate just to give the money back to you? You don't make any sense at all I'm afraid we can't reach a deal.",1,1
1278,0,"Wow, this all looks really nice!",0,0

1280,0,"Wow, great! That must be you are going to give me a great deal!",0,0
1281,0,For sure I can offer you all these chairs at a great low price of 950.00,0,0
1282,0,"Wow, thats steep still! I can pay cash right now for 450",6,6
1283,0,"I understand, these are high quality business chairs. Production is guaranteed! I will not only offer you them at 950 I can throw in an additional 2 more chairs.",6,6
1284,0,"Thats great, but I do not need any more. How about 500 for whats listed?",4,4
1285,0,I think at this point if I would go any lower it would most likely be 800.00 which is a steal in all honesty.,4,4
1286,0,That is still a lot. I think we cannot agree. It's been a pleasure though.,3,3
1287,0,I agree. You have a nice day!,0,0

1317,0,"If the headphones cost the same price brand new, then I'll just do that then. I'll pay $100, final offer",2,2
1318,0,"Agreed, you got a good deal at $100. Thanks",0,0

1391,0,I can't accept that amount. Would $3575 work for you?,4,4
1392,0,No that is too high for me. My budget is only up to $3300 and that is cutting it close,7,7

1423,0,"It looks nice in the photo, however I am concerned that there seems to be some damage to the finish...",1,1
1424,0,"there is a little damage, but it can easily be refinished. I'm willing to drop the price to $600 so that you can cover the cost of the repairs",6,6
1425,0,"Refinishing is quite expensive, i'm not sure that would cover it. I was thinking more along the lines of about $450",2,2
1426,0,"I'll arrange to have it refinished, and pay for that out of pocket, if you agree to $600 purchase price",6,6
1427,0,That seems overly complicated. I'd rather get the refinishing done myself and not have to put out so much cost upfront.,2,2
1428,0,"in that case, best I can do is $550. take it or leave it",3,3
1429,0,"You seem kind of rude, so I'd rather not. Thanks anyway.",1,1

1551,0,"yes, that is possible!",0,0
1552,0,Cool. Would you be willing to lower the price?,4,4
1553,0,"I cant lower the price because it is leased through hayward toyota and this is the balance that needs to be paid off. The good news is that once it is transferred to you, you can just make payments every month and dont need to have all of the money at one time",2,2

1564,0,I can include utilities for 2000.00,6,6
1565,0,That is still a little steep considering how small this unit is. I would really have to do some downsizing to be able to move it. I am very interested in it though. Can you do any better on the price?,2,2
1566,0,Well since it is a brand new property with secured entry and controlled access I can offer one month free on storage with no utilities paid for 1950.00,6,6

1594,0,I bought the truck new and I am the owner. It is legit.,0,0
1595,0,Ok well it looks like a great truck and really need something like this. However the price is a little over what I want to spend.... Is there anyway you would take $9000?,4,4
1596,0,"9000 is a bit low. But, I am willing to go down to 10000 if you can afford that.",4,4
1597,0,"If the truck is still under manufacture warranty? I'm mainly just concerned about the year, it's a 10 year old truck.",1,1
1598,0,It is actually. No need to be concerned.,0,0
1599,0,"Okay. $10,000 would work for me. Thank you.",0,0

1606,0,"Actually, I have 2 dogs, a cat, a fish and a boa constrictor.  I would use the 2nd bedroom to house them.",0,0
1607,0,As long as you pay the pet fees for the dogs and cat I don't see that as a problem. Are you okay with my proposed price?,0,0
1608,0,"Well, it seems kind of high.  I am just 22 and starting my career.  I may need to put my pets up for adoption.",7,7
1609,0,"Well due to the high demand of the apartment as well as all of the utilities and amentities provided, I can't go any lower than $2000.",2,2

1697,0,"I was looking to spend closer to $100. But if you can take it in for a tune-up before I buy it, I might be able to spend a little more.",6,6
1698,0,"No problem. I can do it. However, I need at least $130 to let it go",4,4
1699,0,You couldn't come down to $120? That'll be half of my paycheck for this week. I work a part-time job while I'm in school and don't have a ton of disposable income.,7,7

1731,0,"This is true, There are larger ones for same price, so I feel my price is fair. I would also pick up the item at your convience.",2,2

1757,0,I can't afford $100 because I am not working full time. I just have a certain budget. I can only pay $76 for it,7,7
1758,0,"That is a really big difference!  I will also throw in a helmet and bring the price down to $95.  So, you will get the bike, the helmet, delivery, and a 3 month warranty.  I feel that this is more than fair.  Wouldn't you agree?",6,6
1759,0,I would appreciate if you waive the other options as I just want the bike for my kid. Can we work $80 for it?,4,4
1760,0,Can we split the difference and agree on 87.50?,4,4

1909,0,"I would like to do $99 because I found one for $75 online, but it is too far away. I prefer to have the subs sooner rather than later, but I don't mind waiting if I only have to spend $75. I can offer $99 and pick it up myself so you don't have to worry about a shipping price or the gas to bring it to my place.",6,6

2413,0,"Before we talk price, why wouldn't I want this, Whats wrong with it?",1,1
2414,0,I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this table. It has the expected wear and tear of it being perfectly vintage but other than that it's a beautiful table with smooth working drawers and a very sturdy base.,0,0
2415,0,Why haven't you bothered restoring it?,1,1
2416,0,"To keep it as vintage as possible, and for the buyer to restore it as they want, should they see fit.",0,0
2417,0,"Well I really can't justify paying $135 for an old side table, I have a budget of $55, so I can do that if you deliver it.",6,6

2427,0,"Only 95,000. It runs great, very fuel efficient",0,0
2428,0,"What's the story behind the salvaged title? That seems like a pretty serious red flag. You're asking $4,700 for a pretty old car with a lot of miles on it.",1,1
2429,0,It was just a little bump I got fixed up after the accident. I claimed it as a salvaged car for insurance purposes.,0,0
2430,0,"I see. Well, considering the age and condition. Multiple owners, the salvaged title and all that... I could give you $3,000 for it.",4,4
2431,0,"I don't know about that. It's a strong car, very dependable it's Japanese. The part's total to $4000 alone.",2,2
2432,0,"Understood.  But based on the age and condition. I guess I could do $3,750 as my very best and final offer.",3,3

2511,0,"I was wondering about the mileage being so high, maybe we could cut down the price to about 4200, being that im going to have to replace the engine and possibly the transmission soon",1,1
2512,0,"Well, the mileage is high because I have to travel a lot for business, and this was the car I drove all around the southwest. I'd be willing to let it go for $6000.",2,2
2513,0,I like how the interior has been redone and the tow package is installed along with the other work done in the past year. Ill probably go 5200 at the highest. Maybe throw in free shipping to my current location?,6,6
2514,0,"I could have it delivered to you next week, for $5500.",6,6
2515,0,"Alright, I 'm feelign a little better now, does the car include a warranty of any kind?",5,5

2521,0,"This was my first car with a camera in it. I don't think I'll ever buy another car without it. When you get it, you think ""I'll never use that"" but then you come to rely on it more and more.",0,0
2522,0,Huh. interesting. What's the mileage on the car?,1,1
2523,0,"It's got just under 45,000 miles.",0,0
2524,0,that's right around the average for about 4 year old car.. Tell you what? I like the car so i,0,0
2525,0,Yes?,0,0
2526,0,sorry my chat was misbehaving. i was going to say I'll give you 5000. I'll come and pick it up,6,6

2535,0,"Sounds nice, how far fro the train stations is it?",5,5
2536,0,half mile,0,0
2537,0,"Good, would you take 2800? I would need a 13 month lease.",4,4
2538,0,"I am sorry its actually 4092,please tell me a close number",4,4
2539,0,"Well , the most I could do would be 3700.",3,3
2540,0,"Great ,lets make a deal then",0,0
2541,0,Ok sounds great I will be over to sign the lease.,0,0
2542,0,Hello!,0,0
2543,0,Are you interested in 6 Commodore Drive Unit C430?,0,0
2544,0,"I am, but I was wondering if there was any chance of the price being negotiable.",4,4
2545,0,"Hello, are you there?",0,0
2546,0,I have a little wiggle room.,4,4
2547,0,Computer froze up for a moment.,0,0
2548,0,"I just live everything about it, but I am looking to pay below $2000.",4,4
2549,0,"Hm.  Well, remember that this is a 1 bedroom 1 bath in a fantastic area.",4,0
2550,0,I understand that. This is the one place where I have been lookin for an apartment to become available.,0,0
2551,0,It's also been renovated.  It has a great parking space that comes with the apartment.,0,0
2552,0,Would you take $2000? It is only a little less than what you are asking.,4,4
2553,0,"What about $2100?  I think that's fair.  This does include a lot of luxuries, including community laundry rooms, heated pools, hot tubs, saunas, and a fitness center.",2,2
2554,0,What do you think?,0,0
2555,0,"Oh, I wasn't made aware of those amenities!!! If I fixed things up that need repairs would you take the $2000?",6,6
2556,0,"That's still a little low.  Actually, the place has granite counter tops and gorgeous flooring in there already.  I'm still looking for $2100.",2,2
2557,0,It is definitely over my original budget of under $1500 that I was looking for. I may need to keep looking even though this place is great.,7,7
2558,0,I tell you what...let me see if we can do $2050.  What do you think?,4,0
2559,0,I think I could do the extra $50. That seems fair.,0,0
2560,0,Deal!,0,0
2561,0,Thank you for being considerate.,0,0
2562,0,Does it come furnished?,5,5
2563,0,We can make sure it's furnished for you if you prefer.,0,0
2564,0,How many bedrooms and bathrooms?,5,5
2565,0,It is a 2 bedroom 1 1/2 bath,0,0
2566,0,is the 2nd bedroom big enough for 2 twin beds and maybe some room for the kids to play?,5,5
2567,0,yes the 2nd bedroom is about 10x12,0,0
2568,0,How far away from the school is it?,5,5
2569,0,"It is walking distance from the school, a couple of blocks.",0,0
2570,0,Would you be willing to go $2450?,4,4
2571,0,I can go $2700 with furniture or $2500 without furniture.,6,6
2572,0,I can do the 2500 if it comes with appliances in the kitchen at least.,6,6
2573,0,I can make sure there is a refrigerator and stove for $2500.  The refrigerator and stove will be purchased and already installed before you move in.,6,6
2574,0,Sounds great.,0,0
2575,0,Hi. How many miles are on this car?,5,5
2576,0,65000 original miles. It has been well maintained and I have all the records.,0,0
2577,0,"Great! Last week I saw a similar vehicle with 70000 miles for 14,500. So 20000 is too high for me. Would you be willing to take $15200?",4,4
2578,0,"It comes with an extra transmission, radiator, fuel pump and I will warranty it for 10000 miles or 18 months whichever comes first.",6,6
2579,0,"Ok. Are you willing to take $15500? I can have a buddy come with me to pick it up, so you don't have to worry about moving it anywhere.",6,6
2580,0,I can't go that low. I could do 19000 but no extra transmission at that price.,4,4
2581,0,"Ok. Since you want 19000 and I want 15500, let's meet in the middle and settle on 17250, with no extra transmission. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?",4,4
2582,0,I'll go 17250 with no warranty and no extra transmission.,6,6
2583,0,How about 18000 and include the warranty?,6,6
2584,0,Ok I'll do that.,0,0
2585,0,I love the look of your chair! I have a couple of questions: What time period is the frame from? When was it reupholstered? Why are you getting rid of it?,1,1
2586,0,"It's not too old maybe about 50 years or so, but it is hand made in the old european tradition. everything on it is original, sturdy well made no creaking. i'",0,0
2587,0,What is the material on the back and cushion made of?,5,5
2588,0,"chat misbehaved. sorry about that. i'm selling it because i don't need it anymore. and need some quick cash. as for the materials for the back and cushion, i don't really know, i think it might be double weaved cotton? Not sure.",0,0
2589,0,"In looking at comps, and this being not as old as it appears, would you be willing to negotiate on the price? I am thinking $175. I will pick up and load myself",6,6
2590,0,Sure but I can't go that low. The lowest I can go is about 300. I can deliver it for you,6,6
2591,0,How about 250 if I come pick up?,6,6
2592,0,tell you what. 275 and you got a deal,4,4
2593,0,Let's split the difference and go $260.,4,4
2594,0,you come and pick it up? fine that's a deal,6,6
2595,0,You betcha. Thanks!,0,0
2596,0,So interested in this apartment?,0,0
2597,0,"Yes, but the list price is higher than I was planning to pay.",4,4
2598,0,I see what were you hoping for,0,0
2599,0,"I really was hoping for $1500, but I don't know if that is actually realistic.",4,4
2600,0,That would be too sharp of a drop unfortunately please understand this is a premium apartment i could manage 2500,2,2
2601,0,I could do $2000.,4,4
2602,0,going that low would significantly affect your security deposit amount but it is possible,0,0
2603,0,What are you looking for in terms of a security deposit?,5,5
2604,0,well on average with good credit we get 387 however lowering the rent that much may push you into a thousand,0,0
2605,0,"I could go as high as $1200 on the security deposit, if the rent is $2000.",6,6
2606,0,Well that sounds like we might have a deal,0,0
2607,0,Ok. Good,0,0
2608,0,Hi,0,0
2609,0,"Hello, how are you?",0,0
2610,0,"good thanks, interested in the amp.",0,0
2611,0,Great! The amp is in mint condition. It even has  built in wifi and blue tooth,0,0
2612,0,"nice, does it include the cords needed to hook it up?",5,5
2613,0,it does include the cords to hook it up. It will come in its original box and accessories,0,0
2614,0,Are you flexible on the price?,4,4
2615,0,i am pretty firm at $949,3,3
2616,0,"I was hoping you would accept $721 cash, and I would come to pick it up.",6,6
2617,0,I can accept $721 if you pick it up with cash in hand tonight. But after tonight I won't go less than $900,6,6
2618,0,"ok , that would be awesome for me, on a budget. I will bring the cash now!",0,0
2619,0,"Hi, what can I tell you about this bike? It's really cool and is vintage!",0,0
2620,0,"Yes, I can see that!  Are all the parts original Schwinn?",5,5
2621,0,Yes they are! They're in great condition too.,0,0
2622,0,No rust?,1,1
2623,0,No rust at all. It rides really smoothly and I've never had a problem with rusting in the 10 years I've owned the cruiser,0,0
2624,0,What about the chain.  Has it ever been replaced or is it the original chain,1,1
2625,0,"No, it's the original!",0,0
2626,0,I'm asking because we don't have a Schwinn store in the area and I hate to order parts online.,0,0
2627,0,"The original makes it more vintage and classic, to be honest. Also, apologies-- I actually forgot to tell you the tires are new and they're Kendra, not Schwinn. But you'd want new tires anyways since new tires are what keep the cruiser riding smoothly. You wouldn't want tires from the 60s.",0,0
2628,0,"Lol It was a good time, but yeah, you're right.  Ok, so what's the rock bottom price you would accept for this beauty?",4,4
2629,0,I'd be willing to sell for $200.,4,4
2630,0,Ouch!!  My budget is very tight and I want this bike soooooooo bad.  Would you be willing to accept 190?,7,7
2631,0,Sure. $190 is fine.,0,0
2632,0,Great!,0,0
2633,0,"Hello, I am interested in you iPad mini. Is it still available?",0,0
2634,0,"Yes, it is!",0,0
2635,0,"Great, is the price negotiable?",4,4
2636,0,"Somewhat, but this is in amazing condition and it includes the case.",0,0
2637,0,I actually have a case so I don't need or want the case. You can keep it and sell it separately.,6,6
2638,0,"Okay, without the case I would be asking $165.",6,6
2639,0,This is a first gen model and only has 32GB. I would like to pay $75.,4,4
2640,0,There is no way I can do that. I would be happy to take $150.,4,4
2641,0,I just don't see that it is worth that. How about $100.,4,4
2642,0,"I would be willing to meet you in the middle, but I cannot take a penny under $125.",4,4
2643,0,I suppose I could do that if you are willing to deliver the iPad.,6,6
2644,0,"okay, I can do that.",0,0
2645,0,how we doing today,0,0
2646,0,great you?,0,0
2647,0,good ok so lets get down to business,0,0
2648,0,You're looking to buy some tires? These are pristine,0,0
2649,0,i need them badly however I have a little financial problem ;),7,7
2650,0,"I'm flexible on price, how much are you thinking?",4,4
2651,0,"i am thinking towards the nine hundred area , is that good for you?",4,4
2652,0,I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1000?,4,4
2653,0,"I would be willing to do that  if you deliver it to me , because I am 200 miles out, ok",6,6
2654,0,"Yes, I can definitely do that.",0,0
2655,0,ok good day then,0,0
2656,0,"Hello, is this house still for sale?",5,5
2657,0,"Yes, it is still available for leasing. Would you like to come take a tour?",0,0
2658,0,I would love to.  Can you tell me a little about it?,5,5
2659,0,It is a 3 Bedroom 1 bath home. In great neighborhood. It's professionally maintained. It is a must see house.,0,0
2660,0,What are you asking for the house?,5,5
2661,0,Rent is $1595 a month. Utilities are not included.,0,0
2662,0,Are you able to go any lower?  The comps around the neighboorhood are cheaper than this price.,4,4
2663,0,"We can offer you a discount of $100/mo if you can sign 1 year lease, providing that your application is approved.",6,6
2664,0,Would you be willing to accept 1395 if I signed a 2 year lease?,6,6
2665,0,"Sorry, right now we can only offer the $100 discount. Remember we do the maintenance, including landscapes. That alone adds value to your lease.",6,6
2666,0,"Ok, well I think 1395 is a fair deal if you will be able to pay for half the utilities.  That is my last offer, take it or leave it.",6,6
2667,0,"Hey so I have a great amp for sale, it's only $45. It was much more new.",0,0
2668,0,How old is the Fender amp?,1,1
2669,0,"It's only 5 years old, it's in great condition. The only thing you have to worry about is a slight bit of rust in the corners, but that should come off with some elbow grease.",0,0
2670,0,"Okay, would you say the amp works perfectly?",5,5
2671,0,"Yes, it's extremely loud. I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?",0,0
2672,0,I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.,4,4
2673,0,"Well, you'd have to pick it up if I went anything below $37, which I don't think I can do.",6,6
2674,0,I can come pick it up in an hour with cash in hand!,0,0
2675,0,"You need to be here in 30 minutes, I have someone else interested for it at $40 but I'll go with you if you can get here in time.",6,6
2676,0,I am on my way! Thanks,0,0
2677,0,Thank you.,0,0
2678,0,Hi. I am interested in the apartment you have listed. Can you give me a little more information about it?,5,5
2679,0,Well its a great place well designed and well lit,0,0
2680,0,Are there any swimming pools? Any utilities included in the monthly price? How new is the unit?,5,5
2681,0,No pools but we have a fitness center and we are close to a lot of entertainment venues. We have a pet spa and a fire pit for get together and of course the maintenance of all these amenities is included in the price,0,0
2682,0,Is there any utilities included? How new is the unit? These were not answered in your above answer.,5,5
2683,0,No utilities and the unit is only in its 5 th year however all appliances are upgrades and so are the fixtures so I can promise a fairly low utility bill in relation to your utility usage,0,0
2684,0,"The monthly price is a bit steep, are you able to negotiate?",4,4
2685,0,You know what normally i would say no but im gonna go talk to my manager and see what he say give me a few,4,4
2686,0,"Okay, thank you so much.",0,0
2687,0,Oh my God this never happens my. Manager is willing to waive your application fee and take ten dollars off your monthly rent with the first month free meaning you'll only have to pay 936 per month I swear this never happens and I have no idea what's gotten into him.,0,0
2688,0,"While that is a great deal, is there anyway he would go to $800 a month with all the above terms. I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.",7,7
2689,0,I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off. I think with his current mood  i could get him to 926 and throw in a key to the gym,6,6
2690,0,Do you think that you could talk him into $850?,4,4
2691,0,no and.  I dont want to bother him too much or else his mood may go bad,4,4
2692,0,"Awe, that is still pretty steep.",4,4
2693,0,Give me another few mins ill grill him a little more,0,0
2694,0,"Okay, thank you. I really hope you can get him down more. Like I said, I would be a long term renter and I pay on time every month.",4,4
2695,0,ok so I spoke to him and he got a little annoyed but that may have worked in your favor he said 900 and that's it final offer,3,3
2696,0,"Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?",6,6
2697,0,Why of course and i promise as soon as you move in you will see the value of the place,0,0
2698,0,"Okay, you got yourself a deal.",0,0
2699,0,Hi.  I am interested in the truck you have for sale.  Could you tell me about it' accident history?,1,1
2700,0,"My truck here, who me and my boys call the Yellow Jacket, has no accidents, you can even look it up on that fox car deal. It was well maintained and I keep up with the oil change.",0,0
2701,0,"WHen you say no check engine light, do you mean there IS no check indicator or it doesn't work?",1,1
2702,0,"the indicator is what I meant, Its a good truck she been with me thick and thin, haul big loads so if you need a work truck here you go or even just cause you like trucks this one is for you.",0,0
2703,0,"I am actually looking at it for my son. He has gotten a summer job working on a farm.  But that check engine light is an important thing i may have to have replaced.  Will you accept $3,100 for the truck?",4,4
2704,0,"I can do at  $3,400 and get this gal I know who does tax, title and license all for this price . the no check engine light comment means it is not on so that means no problems its a good truck lets get that going today?",6,6
2705,0,Oh. that makes more sense.  I cannot go above $3200.,3,3
2706,0,"For a 2001 Dodge ram with only 184k miles well maintained you getting a steal, lets do $3300 and I get you some seat covers too to protect the already clean seats since it going to be your boys truck",6,6
2707,0,No seat covers are needed.  $3220 and i can pick it up day and you will have a deal.,6,6
2708,0,Okay I take it,0,0
2709,0,"Hello, you are interested in the ad for the sofa set?",0,0
2710,0,Yes I really like it can you tell me more about the set?,5,5
2711,0,"Sure, this is a 2 piece set. We've got the sofa and the chair as pictured. You saw the dimensions in the ad I assume? The sofa is 94 inches across and the chair is 38 inches. I would be willing to take $1250 for the pair.",0,0
2712,0,I really like it but could offer you $600 and I will come and pick it up myself and provide my own truck,6,6
2713,0,"Understood, but that's pretty far below what we paid for it and I know the sofa alone is worth more than $600.",4,4
2714,0,Ok I understand that is a low offer but the condition does not look that great. how about $750,4,4
2715,0,The condition is actually very good. The set has been in a smoke free home and has seen very little wear from use.  I could go to $1100.,2,2
2716,0,that is still quite high can we agree on $1000,4,4
2717,0,"I could do $1,000. Do you have someone who can help you with the pick up?",0,0
2718,0,yes I have a friend who will help me and he has a pick up truck $1000 it is then,0,0
2719,0,Hi. Is your sub box still for sale?,0,0
2720,0,Yes it is.,0,0
2721,0,The picture isn't visible. Can you tell me what color it is?,5,5
2722,0,"Yes, I'm not sure why the picture isn't visible. The box is stained in a redwood semi transparent stain.",0,0
2723,0,Cool. Did you build it?,5,5
2724,0,"Yes, it is a custom design. I did have help with the fabrication.",0,0
2725,0,Any damage to it?,1,1
2726,0,No damage at all it is still mint.,0,0
2727,0,Sounds like it might work for me though I was looking for something a little bigger. How $25?,4,4
2728,0,I'd really like to get at least 45 for it. It is in mint condition. I can deliver it wherever you like.,6,6
2729,0,No problem picking it up if you are nearby. I'd go that high only if you included on eof the Alpines. I can go $30 if you help install it in my car.,6,6
2730,0,"I would be willing to do that, so long as you pick it up. I can help you install. 30$ will work.",6,6
2731,0,Sounds great! I can pick it up tonight.,0,0
2732,0,very good,0,0
2733,0,see you in an hour (I know where you live). Bye.,0,0
2734,0,Hello,0,0
2735,0,Hello!,0,0
2736,0,You looking to but,0,0
2737,0,The bike looks great. Do you know how new the tires are?,5,5
2738,0,I replaced them about a year ago.,0,0
2739,0,Do you know how many miles are on them?,5,5
2740,0,They just sat there. I'd guess 10-20 at the most.,0,0
2741,0,Hmmm...Just sitting there isn't good for a bike. That makese me a bit nervous. I'm happy to offer $150 for this without any new tires on them.,4,4
2742,0,"That's too low for me, how about $180?",4,4
2743,0,$180 is a bit high for me but I could settle at $175 in as-is condition,4,4
2744,0,"That'd work, better than having it just sit and riot.",0,0
2745,0,"HI, I was interested in the apartment",0,0
2746,0,"excellent it has 2 rooms and 1 and a half bathrooms. got everything stove, refrigerator dishwasher and garbage disposal",0,0
2747,0,is it furnished?,5,5
2748,0,Hello?,0,0
2749,0,yes it is furnished,0,0
2750,0,"Oh, okay, Nice :-)",0,0
2751,0,the rent is 1800,0,0
2752,0,"well, I wasn't looking for something quite that high, could it be closer to 1700?",4,4
2753,0,1800 is final but look at it this way. I will pay for the water. so no water bill for you. this is a lot of savings for you,6,6
2754,0,"true, its good not to have that bill,but I wasnt looking to spend that much a month, is there no way to lower the monthly a little?",4,4
2755,0,"did i mention your laudry is on site? haha very well 1700$ is fine. do remember that no animals, or smoking is allowed. no exceptions",6,6
2756,0,"Clean clothes is a good thing ;-) I understand the rules, they make sense! Thank you, I will take the place for 1700",0,0
2757,0,excellent,0,0
2758,0,Hello how can I help you?,0,0
2759,0,I'm interested in purchasing the sub box.,0,0
2760,0,Sure!,0,0
2761,0,What's the best price you can give me for it?,0,0
2762,0,I am taking it out for $50. I can give it to you for $45. This costed me more than what I expected to be made. They're custom molded around the latch and the inside of the tailgate. The box is going to fit in most vehicles universally.,0,0
2763,0,How about $20?,4,4
2764,0,That's too low. The last I can do is $40,3,3
2765,0,$25?,4,4
2766,0,I can do $40 last,3,3
2767,0,$30?,4,4
2768,0,$40 is last,3,3

2771,0,Sure that's fine.,0,0
2772,0,Hello! I am very much interested in purchasing this bike. Do you have it only in blue color?,5,5
2773,0,"Yes, I only have to one bike and it is blue. It was recently painted so there are no defects in the paint",0,0
2774,0,"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",7,7
2775,0,I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.,2,2
2776,0,$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,7,7
2777,0,What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.,4,4
2778,0,I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,6,6
2779,0,That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.,6,6
2780,0,I cannot go beyond $150.,3,3
2781,0,"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties.",3,3
2782,0,How about $180 and I can come get it from you right away?,6,6
2783,0,Ok. for $180 that would work.,0,0
2784,0,hello. oscilloscope for sale here.,0,0
2785,0,Hi would you take 320?,4,4
2786,0,NO that's way too low,4,4
2787,0,how abour 330?,4,4
2788,0,that's just 10 bucks above your last offer. no.,4,4
2789,0,331?,4,4
2790,0,um... no. tell you what. i'll let you have it for... 450,4,4
2791,0,oh... thank you max budget was 349 :(,7,7
2792,0,ah fair enough. maybe look elsewhere. good luck,4,4
2793,0,ok good selling it for that price,0,0
2794,0,i am interested in the trunk,0,0
2795,0,"Hey there, you're interested in the trunk?",0,0
2796,0,yeah,0,0
2797,0,"What's your budget? It's pretty vintage/antique, and I've had it for a while",0,0
2798,0,i want to pay 150 dollars for it,4,4
2799,0,"I can't do that, 200 at least",3,3
2800,0,it is a rather nice piece. I can come closer to you how about 185?,4,4
2801,0,"This is priceless to my family. I'm going to offer 200, and I will not budge lower than that.",3,3
2802,0,"well that is just a nudge to high, can you get it close to my house?",6,6
2803,0,"Oh yeah, I'll drop it off, tomorrow?",0,0
2804,0,alright then i will pay 200.,0,0
2805,0,I'm interested in this but is there anything wrong with it?,1,1
2806,0,"No there's nothing wrong with it at all. It's brand new, never been used.",0,0
2807,0,And will I be able to use it on any phone service?,5,5
2808,0,Yes it can be used on all carriers.,0,0
2809,0,I would like to buy this for 540 today.,4,4
2810,0,That's not what they are going for. They are going for 850 and I'm selling them for 780 to sell them faster.,4,4
2811,0,"I cannot pay that much. I have seen most closer to 600, which is more in my price range.",7,7
2812,0,"Check again, most of them are selling for 850, this is the 128 GB version not the lower ones. I can go down to 750 but that's it.",4,4
2813,0,How about 720?,4,4
2814,0,740 and we have a deal.,4,4
2815,0,Okay deal,0,0
2816,0,Hello.,0,0
2817,0,hello,0,0
2818,0,"Yes, I'm interested in the binoculars from your ad?",0,0
2819,0,"Oh, sure!  They are still available",0,0
2820,0,Are there any problems with the binoculars?,1,1
2821,0,"No, none that I know of.  I just do not use them as much as I thought I would.",0,0
2822,0,"Well, then I suppose I'd be willing to take them off your hands. I'd like to pay$216 for the binoculars.",4,4
2823,0,"My asking price $380.  I could go slightly lower but I can not sell them for $216, sorry.",4,4
2824,0,"Well, what would your best price be?",0,0
2825,0,$340 would be fine with me,4,4
2826,0,"Well, I'd be willing to drive over and pick them up, if you can come down to $260.",6,6
2827,0,"$300 would be my best offer, I do not think I can go lower, sorry.",3,3
2828,0,"Well, I suppose that's fair. I'll accept that price.",0,0
2829,0,Great!,0,0
2830,0,Hi! What is the history behind this bed?,5,5
2831,0,"Hello, you are interested in the hospital bed?",0,0
2832,0,"Yes, I am, can you tell me more about it?",5,5
2833,0,"This bed was rarely used, only as an overflow bed. We have since went with a new supplier so this is not necessary any longer. It is fully electric, so anyone who needs to move about can do so with ease.",0,0
2834,0,When was it originally purchased?,5,5
2835,0,It was purchased early this year.,0,0
2836,0,Okay. I'd definitely like it. Would you be able to accept $1000?,4,4
2837,0,"Well considering its condition, I think 1800 is much more fair price.",4,4
2838,0,How about 1400 and I'll pick it up?,6,6
2839,0,"There is a brand new mattress included with this bundle, can we do $1600?",6,6
2840,0,Sure. That seems fair,0,0
2841,0,Hello,0,0
2842,0,"Hi, I'm interested in your Kia Rio.",0,0
2843,0,"Awesome, do you have any questions? It is in really great shape, we have taken great care of it.",0,0
2844,0,I'm offering $2450 but I am willing to negotiate,4,4
2845,0,"Alright, I'm willing to negotiate as well, but $2450 is pretty low. Do you have any questions about the car itself?",4,4
2846,0,How long have you used it for?,1,1
2847,0,"I haven't had it long at all but my Grandmother had it before me and I know firsthand that she had it professionally serviced only at the dealer and it has been perfectly maintained, no accidents or anything.",0,0
2848,0,Okay. Does it include a spare tire?,5,5
2849,0,"Yep, it does. Also, never been in an accident, and has a clean title.",0,0
2850,0,Okay. I'm willing to pay $2800 and nothing less.,3,3
2851,0,"Alright well I'm glad you're not willing to pay any less than that, but I'm afraid you're going to have to offer a bit more...",4,4
2852,0,$2825 is my final offer.,3,3
2853,0,"Sorry, I can go as low as $3000 but your offer isn't very reasonable.",3,4
2854,0,Hello,0,0
2855,0,Hello!,0,0
2856,0,Are you interested in the chaise?  It's very comfortable and in great condition,0,0
2857,0,Very interested but 309 is a bit much,4,4
2858,0,What would you like to offer?,0,0
2859,0,150,4,4
2860,0,Hmmm.  Thanks for your offer but that's less than I can accept.  How about $200?,4,4
2861,0,I can do 160,4,4
2862,0,How about $180?,4,4
2863,0,Hello,0,0
2864,0,Hi again!  Did you see my offer of $180?,0,0
2865,0,Yes i did if i pay that will you deliver?,6,6
2866,0,Absolutely!  No problem!,0,0
2867,0,Then 180 sounds great,0,0
2868,0,any questions about the item?,0,0
2869,0,Can you tell me about the apartment? 2450 seems quite a bit above the going rate in that neighboorhood. I was looking for closer to 1225,4,4
2870,0,this is completely remodeled.  It is like new,0,0
2871,0,"the pictures look great, but it still seems a bit pricey compared to other apartments in the area. I can do 1600, just because I like that building",4,4
2872,0,i can go 2200 a month,4,4
2873,0,"ummm. I don't know, it doesn't even have a washer/dryer. I would have to share with the neighbor. I could go up to 1900 if you put in a washer/dryer",2,2
2874,0,2100 and the washer and dryer are yours,6,6
2875,0,That is still way too high for the area. I'm pretty firm on the 1900. I have a great history as a renter with lots of referneces. I won't trash your place and pay my rent on time.,3,3
2876,0,"ok, 2000",4,4
2877,0,How about 1950 and the washer and dryer. I think we could both be happy with that.,6,6
2878,0,hi,0,0
2879,0,"Hi, I like your bike. It reminds me of one I used to own back in the day. I would jump it off ramps while rocking a TMNT t-shirt.",0,0
2880,0,its a nice bike normal wear and tear,0,0
2881,0,Is the chain rusty? It looks as though it hasn't been greased in a while.,1,1
2882,0,no rust but it needs a brake,0,0
2883,0,"The asking price is fair, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to pay $150 for it. If you do the $150, I'll perform some awesome wheelies for you before I leave.",4,4
2884,0,"it is 27 years old you can not find these anymore, how about $170",4,4
2885,0,"You're right, those bikes are hard to come by. How about we meet in the middle and do $160?",4,4
2886,0,$165 is as low as i can go,3,3
2887,0,"If it had the original wheels, I would do the $165. But I need to stay firm at $160. It's a good compromise I feel.",2,2
2888,0,"You are right about the wheels, ok $160",0,0
2889,0,Deal!,0,0
2890,0,Ok,0,0
2891,0,Hey I see you are interested in this iPad air case,0,0
2892,0,"Yes, it's compatible with my Air 2.",0,0
2893,0,Did you look at all of the features and the keyboard.,0,0
2894,0,"Yes, and I do like it. But, I'm worried about how it will stand up over time.",1,1
2895,0,I can assure you the case is very durable and can handle the normal iPad user.,0,0
2896,0,How did that label fall off?,1,1
2897,0,My child was playing with it and I did not realize until it was too late.,0,0
2898,0,"Okay, well, I like it. I was hoping to get it for $10, but since it looks nice and has the keyboard, I would go $15.",4,4
2899,0,I think thats a reasonable offer and I accept.,0,0
2900,0,great,0,0
2901,0,Hello,0,0
2902,0,Hello are you still selling the Settee?,0,0
2903,0,"Yes, I am. I am asking 200 dollars for it, but I am willing to listen to offers and make a deal.",0,0
2904,0,Sounds good. What does the wear and tear look like on it though? What kind of condition is it in?,1,1
2905,0,"It is in good condition. There are no holes, or scratches.",0,0
2906,0,How long have you had it for?,1,1
2907,0,Only a year and have barely sat on it. It is like new.,0,0
2908,0,Oh okay that's good. Could you come down on the price at all? I've seen some used ones going for a lot less.,4,4
2909,0,Sure. How much would you like to pay for it?,0,0
2910,0,Could you do it for 80?,4,4
2911,0,How about 100 and I will deliver it to you myself?,6,6
2912,0,Okay we have a deal!,0,0
2913,0,Good,0,0
2914,0,Hey is there anything wrong with this?,1,1
2915,0,"Hi, are you interested in the rocker?",0,0
2916,0,Yes I am.,0,0
2917,0,Nothing wrong with it.  We just changed the decor and wanted it to go to a nice home.,0,0
2918,0,Okay and does the cushion also come with it?,5,5
2919,0,Yes it does.  In fact I have 4 cushions I could throw in to make the deal sweeter.,6,6
2920,0,That'd be awesome. Could I come pick it up today?,0,0
2921,0,I'm asking 60$ are you cool with that?,0,0
2922,0,Could yo do $40?,4,4
2923,0,"No, I'm giving you 20 in cushions.  I have to get 60.  I can deliver it also.",6,6
2924,0,If you deliver I think I can swing 60 then.,6,6
2925,0,"Ok, I think we've got a deal!",0,0
2926,0,Hello,0,0
2927,0,hi,0,0
2928,0,I this bike in good condition? I am in need of a new one.,5,5
2929,0,"yes, it only has a couple dings",0,0
2930,0,Are you willing to lower the price? I am on a tight budget.,7,7
2931,0,I could come down to $200 and I can bring it over to you in my truck,6,6
2932,0,"That sounds like a fair deal. But, can I pick it up myself and buy it for 150?",6,6
2933,0,"how about 175? its really nice and in good shape, so meet me halfway?",2,2
2934,0,That sounds good. You got a deal.,0,0
2935,0,cool 175 it is..cheers,0,0
2936,0,"Hi, can you tell me a little more about this house?",5,5
2937,0,Hello,0,0
2938,0,It is a beautiful house,0,0
2939,0,What are some of the perks?,5,5
2940,0,"Great green lawn, garage",0,0
2941,0,Does it have a swimming pool?  My family and I are new to the area and would like to lease for at least 6 mos. maybe more but the kids really would like a pool.  How much wiggle room in the price?,4,4
2942,0,"$3,100.00",4,4
2943,0,That's a little steep.  Would you accept 2975?,4,4
2944,0,3000,4,4
2945,0,Are utilities included?,5,5
2946,0,Yes,0,0
2947,0,"ok, I'll take it for 3000",0,0
2948,0,Hello,0,0
2949,0,Hello! So you're looking for an apartment?,0,0
2950,0,No the house,0,0
2951,0,"I'm sorry, that's what I meant. I have a great single family house for rent that I think would be perfect for you.",0,0
2952,0,But you don't know me,0,0
2953,0,This house is perfect for everyone.,0,0
2954,0,"You mean anyone. Anyways, don't worry I'm interested.",0,0
2955,0,What price were you looking to pay?,0,0
2956,0,"Free, I'm only kidding honey. Listen, I'm wondering if this community is diverse. I'm a single gay father, and I just divorced my wife. Are you still sure this place is perfect for anyone?",1,1
2957,0,"Yes sir, this is a nice house for rent in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are two large master bedrooms and two other single bedrooms with a total of three bathrooms. The house is great for a small family.",2,0
2958,0,"Right, but I'm not really in a family anymore. I will have my daughter occasionally, is it near schools?",5,5
2959,0,It's easily walkable to schools.,0,0
2960,0,"Oh that's nice. I work from home, I'm making a new business so I was thinking it could double as a place to work out of. I don't think with the divorce I will be able to pay what you want.",7,7
2961,0,"The house is listed at $3500 per month, but there's a special going on right now for $2900 per month. I take it that's a bit out of your price range?",4,4
2962,0,"Honey, everything is out of my price range. My wife is Christian. My daughter is 14 and not into having a gay father. Anyways, this house has what I need to be a responsible father in contemporary society. Maybe we could do a 6 month lease at one price and then negotiate further. I have immaculate credit.",6,6
2963,0,Sounds great. Make an offer.,0,0
2964,0,"Right now, I now I could give you 2000 per month easy...",4,4
2965,0,That works well.,0,0
2966,0,Great!,0,0
2967,0,Hello,0,0
2968,0,Hi!,0,0
2969,0,How much are you offering the furniture for?,5,5
2970,0,I would like $400 dollars for it.,0,0
2971,0,How old is it?,1,1
2972,0,"We got it 2 years ago but it is like-new, very well taken care of.",0,0
2973,0,"How many times has it been moved? Are there any dings, bumps or scratches?",1,1
2974,0,It was only moved in when we bought it and no there are none as i said it is like-new!,0,0
2975,0,Will you deliver it?,5,5
2976,0,Of course! If you pay the listed price of $400.,0,0
2977,0,I think that is a little steep for something 2 years old. Would you take $250 if I came and got it?,2,2
2978,0,No not at all if you would like to come and get it i would go as low as 350 but no lower.,6,6
2979,0,Highest I can go is $300,3,3
2980,0,Ok if you come and pick it up.,6,6
2981,0,Awesome I will come and get it. Thank you!,0,0
2982,0,Welcome!:),0,0
2983,0,Hello,0,0
2984,0,Hello,0,0
2985,0,Are you open to negotiation on the Altima?,0,0
2986,0,"Yes, I am. It is a great car and very well maintained. I can get you service records if needed",0,0
2987,0,"That all sounds great, but unfortunately I just lost my job. I can't pay full price for a car, but I do really need one to get to interviews to try to get a new job.",7,7
2988,0,That is an unfortunate situation. What are you able to do?,4,4
2989,0,"I know it's kind of low, but would you be able to take $4000, considering my situation?",7,7
2990,0,"I'd love to help you out, but I can't go that low. How about 6000",4,4
2991,0,6000 is unfortunately still too high for me. Could we meet in the middle at 5000?,4,4
2992,0,"Man I'd love to, but that's cutting a lot off of what I need out of this. How about 5500",4,4
2993,0,$5500 is acceptable. Thanks!,0,0
2994,0,Hello I'm interested in your apartment. Can you tell me if an extra deposit is required?,5,5
2995,0,We do require a deposit based on your credit up to 1 months rent plus a $500 non-refundable deposit if you have cats.,0,0
2996,0,Okay that's possible. And utilities are they included?,5,5
2997,0,"We do include gas, electric, water and trash in the rental price.  There is also wi-fi available in the common areas.",0,0
2998,0,That's super. I'm really hoping we can come down on the price a bit. This is a great place it's just a little out of my comfortable budget at the moment. I'd be stretching it at this price. Are you willing to come down on the price?,7,7
2999,0,Well we do have a special if you sign a 2 year lease we are offering $200 off your rent which would make it $2450.,6,6
3000,0,I really need it to be lower. Otherwise I'm going to be cutting into my essential needs like grocery budget.,7,7
3001,0,Well what price were you looking for?,0,0
3002,0,In an ideal world where I don't have to struggle at all. It would be 1800 (in a super ideal world it would be 200 per month).,4,4
3003,0,"Well I can't go quite that low, that is the price of our 1 bedrooms and this is a 3 bed 2 bath unit.  I will let you in on a little secret, this Saturday we are having a grand re-opening and running a special 2000 a month and no deposit on approved credit.  Would that work better for you?",4,4
3004,0,Yes that's possible. Do you really do this for a living? You are quite good at it. Thank-you.,0,0
3005,0,Is this for sale or rent?,0,0
3006,0,It is for rent.,0,0
3007,0,how many bedrooms are available,5,5
3008,0,This unit is a 3 bedroom.,0,0
3009,0,Are any utilities included?,5,5
3010,0,Utilities are not included in the rent price.,0,0
3011,0,"I would need a lower rent price so that I can pay for utlities, $1000",4,4
3012,0,1000 is far too low. We can bring the price down to 2300 if you have good employment.,4,4
3013,0,"you barely moved on price, how about $1200",4,4
3014,0,"You started from too low of a price, this is a platinum upgraded apartment with premium features. You can't just ask any low ball price and expect a deal.",2,2
3015,0,"Platinum is in quotes in the listing, I'm not so sure of the legitimacy of this apartment",1,1
3016,0,It is easily verified online and also in person at the office. Are you actually interested in the apartment?,2,2
3017,0,"I would have to see it in person, does the complex have a pool or gym?",5,5
3018,0,Yes we have a great pool and also a full gym on site.,0,0
3019,0,"That sounds good, I can do $1500",4,4
3020,0,2200 and we cannot lower the price any further.,3,3
3021,0,ok,0,0
3022,0,"Hey there, I am Brian, I left an email about the apartment for rent.",0,0
3023,0,Hello Brian thanks for writing. Do you have any questions about the apartment?,0,0
3024,0,"I do, it's about the price. I like the location of this apartment very much, but the price is ridiculous. The post says there is a $500 off special. I'm curious, is that deducted from the price you listed the apartment at?",5,5
3025,0,It would be on the price we both agree upon.,0,0
3026,0,"So then with the $500 off, how does $700 sound all together?",4,4
3027,0,There is no way that would be possible.,3,3
3028,0,Then can we work out a deal close to that? I can assure you that I can pay rent on time.,4,4
3029,0,The lowest I'm authorized to go is 900. And that would be the flat monthly rent. The first month's rent would be 400 with the deduction.,3,3
3030,0,"If I give you 900, could we settle free parking for my first month as well?",6,6
3031,0,Yes that can be done. So overall you'll be saving quite a lot. So 900 is good for you?,0,0
3032,0,"Hello, are you interested in the unit?",0,0
3033,0,Yes. How many rooms and baths?,5,5
3034,0,"This is a two-bedroom, one bath.",0,0
3035,0,Please tell me about the neighborhood and neighbors?,5,5
3036,0,"The neighborhood is great. Most people are young professionals who keep business hours, and you'll find the community to be quiet and private. Lots of nearby shops.",0,0
3037,0,Sounds good.  Is the $500 off move in special just for the first month or more?,5,5
3038,0,The $500 move in special is just for the first month.,0,0
3039,0,I'd be willing to pay 1375 if parking is included,6,6
3040,0,"I'll go down to $1425 and include parking, as well as water.",6,6
3041,0,sounds good! Thank you!,0,0
3042,0,Thanks!,0,0
3043,0,Hello.,0,0
3044,0,Hi there!,0,0
3045,0,Are you interested in my home that I have for sale?,0,0
3046,0,"Yes, the home is in a great location and seems to fit my needs wonderfully.",0,0
3047,0,Great!  The price is $3175.,0,0
3048,0,I'd like to offer $2857. I need to factor in the fact that it is a more dated model and that it will need some updating on my end.,2,2
3049,0,I understand what you are saying.  I could offer $2999.  Will that work.,4,4
3050,0,$2899 is the highest I am willing to go.,3,3
3051,0,$2899 sounds fine.  Deal!! Thank you.,0,0
3052,0,Thank you.,0,0
3053,0,hello,0,0
3054,0,Hello. Are you interested in our services?,0,0
3055,0,Yes I am,0,0
3056,0,Ok. We charge $50 for unlocking and flashing phone devices.,0,0
3057,0,That much. Are you willing to discount the price for first time customers,6,6
3058,0,For first time customers we offer a price of $45 for the service.,6,6
3059,0,That's still pretty steep..Hmm what about 35.00?,4,4
3060,0,"Sorry, I can not go that low. The best I could do is $45 and have the device back to you within 30 minutes.",6,6
3061,0,What other services do I get with 45.00?,5,5
3062,0,There are no other services? We unlock and flash phones to remove them from the network--that's what we do.,0,0
3063,0,If you are flashing my phone I still have to pay for first month service. You are not losing anything with 35.00. I still have to pay for first month service.,1,1
3064,0,"I can make you a final offer of $45 to which you can accept or reject. Sorry, our prices are firm.",3,3
3065,0,Do I get a free phone case with it? What about 40.00?,4,4
3066,0,I do not see us reaching an agreement here.,3,3
3067,0,"Hey, is this car still available?",0,0
3068,0,"Yes, it is!",0,0
3069,0,Was this serviced at BMW and do you have the service records?,5,5
3070,0,I have all the service records and they are all up to date.,0,0
3071,0,"Perfect!  I do have to admit, I am a little concerned by the additional work though.  While it's appealing, I'm concerned about how it might affect the reliability.",1,1
3072,0,I can guarantee that I have driven this car for about a year now and haven't had a single issue with it- the car runs perfectly and I have not had to conduct any repairs.,2,2
3073,0,"Ok, that's good.  I feel that 45,000 is a bit high though.  Of course, I do understand that it is a 2016 and has industry standard mileage.  Would you consider coming down on the price some?",4,4
3074,0,"The lowest I'm willing to drop it is 42,500. I've done some serious work to this car.",4,4
3075,0,"Fair, but I go get a 2017 from a dealer for a little more than you're asking.  If I pick up the car and handle all of the paperwork would you consider 38000?",6,6
3076,0,"38,000 just seems too low to me. I could do 41000 as long as you pay in cash, as well as picking up the car and taking care of all the paperwork yourself",6,6
3077,0,"I can do 40,000 cash, pick up and paperwork, but I'd expect the remainder of BMW's factory warranty to be transferred too.  Can we call that a deal?",6,6
3078,0,Sounds good to me!,0,0
3079,0,"Perfect, thanks!",0,0
3080,0,Hi there! Is your vehicle still available?,0,0
3081,0,"Yes, this absolutely gorgeous BMW is still available, but I'm certain it won't be for long!",0,0
3082,0,Great! Is all of the paperwork up to date?,5,5
3083,0,All paperwork is up to date and I have clean title in hand.,0,0
3084,0,Sounds good. Would you be willing to pay for a background check if I make you an acceptable offer>,6,6
3085,0,I have a Carfax report for it in my possession if that is what you are speaking of.,0,0
3086,0,"Yes, that's right. I recently saw a similar model at a dealership for about 30,000 but yours looks better maintained, so I'm happy to make a higher offer for your car. How does 31,500 sound?",4,4
3087,0,"According to Kelly Blue Book value, I have this car priced very close to the value.  Given the pristine condition, year, miles, etc. $31,500 is very low.  I will accept $43,000.  Even at this price, you are getting an awesome deal!",2,2
3088,0,"What if I pick up the car myself? Could you do 35,000?",6,6
3089,0,"Sorry, can't do it.",3,3
3090,0,"I'm sorry, it sounds like our budgets are just too far apart. Good luck with your sale!",0,0
3091,0,Hi are you interested in the house?,0,0
3092,0,Yes I'm interested. Can you tell me more about it? What is the square footage of the place and how many bed/bath?,5,5
3093,0,It's about 2000 square feet and it has three rooms and two bathrooms.,0,0
3094,0,Does it have freeway access?,5,5
3095,0,Yes it is actually very close to freeway access.,0,0
3096,0,"Great! My only issue then is with the pricing, are you open to negotiate or no?",4,4
3097,0,I am open to some negotiating.,0,0
3098,0,"Okay well I was thinking because of the location which isn't the best in town, how about we do 1500?",4,4
3099,0,"$1,500 would be outrageously low and I cannot accept that offer. Can you come closer to 3000?",4,4
3100,0,I'll do 2500 if utilities and internet are included in that monthly price and you waive the deposit.,6,6
3101,0,"We cannot waive the deposit but $2,500 utilities included and we can make a deal today.",6,6
3102,0,"Okay that would actually work for me, thanks!",0,0
3103,0,Are you looking to rent my apartment?,0,0
3104,0,"Wow, this looks like a great place!!",0,0
3105,0,I was thinking $1725 because it is two bedroom and in a convenient area for commuting,0,0
3106,0,Thats great! Those are both really attractive! What is it close to?,5,5
3107,0,"it's close to all the downtown restaurants and stores, can you do $1700?",0,0
3108,0,Awesome! But thats a lot. Can you lower it if I pay cash?,6,6
3109,0,how low?,4,4
3110,0,1100,4,4
3111,0,how about 1300?,4,4
3112,0,"How about 1,200?",4,4
3113,0,Deal!,0,0
3114,0,"Hi, is your dining table still for sale?",0,0
3115,0,It sure is. I just put it up today,0,0
3116,0,Are you willing to be flexible on the price?,4,4
3117,0,"Not really, this is solid wood like new, not Ikea",2,2
3118,0,"I ask because I've seen new solid wood tables for on sale for about $1,000.  For a used table, I would expect to pay at least a bit less.",1,1
3119,0,They don't sell them like  this anymore with the 4 extensions leaves.   - also comes with glass top - that's rare,2,2
3120,0,I did not realize from the ad that this also has a glass top.  Are you able to deliver the table across town?,6,6
3121,0,"Yes, the custom glass cut to fit game table size top would be difficult to transport unless have the kine Pick up truck  set up for that.  I can do that for you so don't break in transportation.",6,6
3122,0,"Sounds wonderful.  Looks like we have a deal, then.",0,0
3123,0,GREAT!.  Has to be over the weekend but will accept. :) Enjoy!,6,6
3124,0,"Hello, I am interested in your iWave speaker. The asking price is $20 correct?",0,0
3125,0,"Yes it is, it's brand new, can I tell you anything about it?",0,0
3126,0,It is brand new correct? Are you willing to go any lower than $20 perhaps?,4,4
3127,0,"Yes, it was an unwanted gift still sealed in packaging. I'm reluctant to go much lower but I might",4,4
3128,0,"I could come pick it up right now for $10, How does that sound?",6,6
3129,0,I wouldn't let it go for less than $15,3,3
3130,0,How about $12? You said yourself it was an unwanted gift. You could have a nice dinner with this atleast. I mean... How good is an iWave anyways?,4,4
3131,0,"I want to get myself something comparable in price so I can show it to the person who gave me the speaker. iWave are excellent, I already have one of their speakers. How about $13.50 and I'll throw in a spare usb cable?",6,6
3132,0,Could we make it an even $13? My change in my cars cup holder is pretty sticky from last nights Taco Bell spill. I would hate to have to give you those quarters right now.,4,4
3133,0,"I wouldn't want those :) $13 it is, I'll see you later! Thank you",0,0
3134,0,"Hello there, i'm very interested in the device, but I'm not sure I can afford it. Would you be willing to accept a lower offer?",7,7
3135,0,Hi there! Yes I am open to negotiating :),0,0
3136,0,I'm assuming this phone doesn't have any damage as you state it is relatively new. It's in good working order then?,5,5
3137,0,Yes it is absolutely in a good working condition and has no scratches or anything. It was always used with the cover and its as new.,0,0
3138,0,"Great, well I'm a bit strapped for cash, so how about $25 in cash.",7,7
3139,0,Woah! That's too too low. I am selling it for 70$. I can go up to $65,4,4
3140,0,I wouldn't have enough money left over for other things at that price. Could you take $40,7,7
3141,0,I can take $50,4,4
3142,0,Fine will go with $45 but I will give you without the cover then!,6,6
3143,0,Ok,0,0
3144,0,"Hi, is the Honda CRV EX still for sale?",0,0
3145,0,Hey,0,0
3146,0,Is the car still for sale?,0,0
3147,0,"Yes, it's still for sale.",0,0
3148,0,I'm looking for a car for my daughter.  Can you tell me more about the car?,5,5
3149,0,"The car gets 27 MPG AVG in the city alone, so I'm not sure where your daughter will need to commute, but it won't cost her much. Also, the car is in great running condition.",0,0
3150,0,She just needs to get back and forth to work but she has to drive freeway miles.  How many miles are on the car?,5,5
3151,0,"I apologize, but for some reason I do not have that information on hand. Can I get back to you ASAP with the exact mileage?",0,0
3152,0,Sure.  I just wanted to know if there are a lot of miles on it.  So what's the least you'll take for it?,0,0
3153,0,"There isn't a whole lot of mileage on it, but I'll let you know for sure. The best I can do is $21,000.",4,4
3154,0,"wozer...! I was looking at maybe $11,000",4,4
3155,0,"I'm sorry but I couldn't let the car go for that amount. I know you need the car for your daughter to get back and forth, so I'll definitely work with you. Would you be willing to pay $16,000 for the car?",4,4
3156,0,"That is still a reach for me.  How about $15,500?",4,4
3157,0,"$15,750 and we have a deal.",4,4
3158,0,Deal!  I can do that.,0,0
3159,0,Sold!,0,0
3160,0,Great.  Please accept my offer on the right.,0,0
3161,0,Hello,0,0
3162,0,"Hi there, I am interested in the LG Viper.",0,0
3163,0,Great! It is in superb condition. I've had it for about a year and I am a fairly light user.,0,0
3164,0,It looks like it's in good condition. The only issue is that I really need a phone and I don't have $55 on my today. I was wondering if you'd be willing to negotiate on the price a little bit?,7,7
3165,0,Depends what you have?,0,0
3166,0,I'd really like to pay $45.,4,4
3167,0,Why don't we go with the middle and call it at $50?,4,4
3168,0,Does it come with a charger?,5,5
3169,0,"Yeah, charger, screen protector already on, and an extra battery.",0,0
3170,0,Hmm. Will you agree on $48?,4,4
3171,0,"Nah, 50",3,3
3172,0,"Ok, $40 is fine.",0,0
3173,0,No,0,0
3174,0,"I mean to type $50 lol, sorry.",0,0
3175,0,lol,0,0
3176,0,"Hi, I am interested in this house. Can you tell what you think it is worth per month?",5,5
3177,0,5 grand,0,0
3178,0,That is ridiculous. I was thinking more around 1700 a month.,4,4
3179,0,Well that's what its worth you can ask city hall if you want they will say 5 grand,2,2
3180,0,"That is funny, because the original list price is only 2480.",1,1
3181,0,"Yeah that's for rent to own, but you have to rent it to own it",0,0
3182,0,"I understand that. So if I wanted to do rent to own and I could set up a direct deposit, how about 1800 a month?",6,6
3183,0,That's already low can you afford 2 grand,4,4
3184,0,I'll split it at 1900. Is that enough?,4,4
3185,0,Makes me think you won't be able to pay rent u low ballin,1,1
3186,0,"That will not be a issue. I said we could set it up as a direct deposit, so obviously I am not worried about having the money. 1950 is my final offer.",3,3
3187,0,Okay I can agree on 1950 if you can find me a way besides Direct deposit that you can prove to me you'll be able to make rent every month,6,6
3188,0,I'll get you a copy of my pay stubs. You will see how much I make.,0,0
3189,0,How much u make a month? How long you been working and how much are your expenses every month?,1,1
3190,0,"You will see it all on my pay stubs. I have never had a problem with rent or any other bills. I have excellent credit, but feel free to check that out too.",0,0
3191,0,Okay we meet,0,0
3192,0,"Hey, I'm interested in the house bu there seems to be some issues.",1,1
3193,0,What issues do you have?,0,0
3194,0,"Well first of all, I don't quite like how it's a row of rooms, there's no width to the house. There's little grass, and the place does not look wheelchair accessible.",1,1
3195,0,"Well, you're definitely right on the money there. We do not have any kind of ramp or alternative method for handicapped people",0,0
3196,0,"So due to all these problems, I'll have to ask you to come down to 1600.",4,4
3197,0,I will not be able to bring it down that much,4,4
3198,0,Well can you install a wheelchair ramp?,6,6
3199,0,"We can install a wheelchair ramp, for sure, to ensure both the front and back entrances are wheelchair accessible",6,6
3200,0,"Okay, so can you come down to $1900?",4,4
3201,0,That would still be cutting the price in half; can't bring it down that much. The lowest we can bring it down to is $3000,3,3
3202,0,"I can do $2600 but not any more, sorry.",3,3
3203,0,We can make $2600 work,0,0
3204,0,Hello,0,0
3205,0,Hi! I am interested in your truck. How is the paint?,5,5
3206,0,"Paint is great, not a single scratch or ding.",0,0
3207,0,"Great! I would be willing to do 600, on account of the fact that it is pretty high mileage.",2,2
3208,0,I'm not sure what you mean. The price it is listed at is $8900. I can negotiate the price a bit though if you are able to pick it up right away.,6,6
3209,0,"I am sorry, I meant 6000. I can come get it today with cash in hand for 6230. How does that sound?",6,6
3210,0,Hmmm that's really low...,4,4
3211,0,"Not really, the pickup is almost 13 years old and the high mileage means that I am bound to have some engine problems not too long after buying it.",1,1
3212,0,"The engine was rebuilt and is in good condition, you shouldn't have any problems with it. It is a great truck and has many good years left on her. If we were talking about a car just for tooling around yeah it might be high but for a truck that can haul what this truck can, you won't find a better deal out there.",2,2
3213,0,"Still, the wear and tear is there. I with just a 4.8 Liter engine I doubt how much hauling it can really do. I can do 7000, but that is it.",3,3
3214,0,"Alright, $7000 is a fair compromise, I can do that.",0,0
3215,0,hi,0,0
3216,0,Hello.  I'd like to buy the bike for 104.,0,0
3217,0,"That is a little low for me, I am willing to come down slightly.",4,4
3218,0,The most I will pay is 115.,3,3
3219,0,well would you be willing to pick it up?,6,6
3220,0,yes I will pick it up,0,0
3221,0,I cannot include the helmet or pump at that price.. or you can have them if you can come up to 145,6,6
3222,0,I don't want the helmet or the pump.  Just the bike.   115 okay?,6,6
3223,0,120 if you can come get it and you have a deal.,6,6
3224,0,I think 115 is a fair price as the one tire has cracks.   115 and I will pick up.,6,6
3225,0,"Sorry that is just too low for me, it was already a price cut at the listed 149.",4,4
3226,0,Hello,0,0
3227,0,hello,0,0
3228,0,Did you have any questions about the item for sale?,0,0
3229,0,How much is it?,5,5
3230,0,$40.00,0,0
3231,0,It looks great. I can offer $20 for it.,4,4
3232,0,Well I can't cut the price in half. It is in excellent working condition. Has a remote control and an adapter.  It is really worth far more than I'm asking for it.,2,2
3233,0,How about $25?,4,4
3234,0,"Sorry, like I said it is worth more than I'm asking. I've already cut it down to $40 to get rid of it quickly.",4,4
3235,0,"All I can afford is $30. If you live in my area, I could arrange to meet with you to pick it up(as opposed to you mailing it.).",6,6
3236,0,"I kind of feel like you've been wasting my time, and starting out with such a lowball offer half price, really kind of sitting wrong with me. I can do $35 and that's as long as I can go.",3,3
3237,0,"Hi, are you interested in my dope bike?",0,0
3238,0,"Hello, I may be interested in your BMX bike you have for sale.",0,0
3239,0,"Its an awesome bike, what is your offer",0,0
3240,0,"Considering it needs a new chain and the brake cable is missing, I think $60 is a fair offer.",4,4
3241,0,"If you throw in something else to sweeten the deal, im in.",4,4
3242,0,"I dont know what I could throw in, its going to be for my son and I would have to still take the bike to have a chain and cable put on so he could ride it.",7,7
3243,0,Do you have any old Hoobastank CDs? I'm a collector,4,4
3244,0,"No, I am not in for trades, I can do cash only.",3,3
3245,0,The only way im going below $90 is with a trade added in. My asking price is $90 and i could buy at least 45 hoobastank CDs with that amount,6,6
3246,0,"Ok, well I see another bike in better condition for cheaper so I will go with the other. thanks for your time.",1,1

3253,0,Maybe. Make an offer.,0,0
3254,0,I would like to pay 1674 on it. Is that at all possible?,4,4
3255,0,"I can't go any lower than $1750, sorry",3,3
3256,0,1750 is fine. Can I come by and see the place today?,0,0
3257,0,Absolutely.,0,0
3258,0,Hello,0,0
3259,0,Hello,0,0
3260,0,Did you have questions about the item for sale?,0,0
3261,0,how fast can it go?,5,5
3262,0,"It can't ""go"" at all... it is an antique. It is being sold as an art piece, to be displayed. Conceivably it could be restored by an expert who knew how to do such a thing but as it is it is just for display.",0,0
3263,0,hmm then i can only offer $75,3,3
3264,0,You seem to not be interested in the item for sale.,1,1
3265,0,i want it but i have to factor in its rarity,2,2
3266,0,"Indeed, it is very rare. Which is why $75 is far too low an offer. The list price of $200 is very reasonable for an item this rare.",4,4
3267,0,i have a meeting to get to what is your best offer,4,4
3268,0,Thanks for viewing the listing.,0,0

3272,0,"The phone is locked to Sprint and we can negotiate, if needed. What would you like to pay?",0,0
3273,0,"I was hoping to get the phone for 20, how does that sound?",4,4
3274,0,That's pretty low. Would you be willing to pay $40?,4,4
3275,0,"I would come up to that price if you threw in some perks, maybe some freebies or a protection plan.",6,6
3276,0,I can throw in a 1 year warranty and even drop the price to $38. Would that work?,6,6
3277,0,How about $38 and we meet at a location closer to me? Deal?,6,6
3278,0,Hello,0,0

3297,0,$2950 and you've got yourself a deal,4,4

3493,0,Can you tell me anything about the breakage on the right arm rest?,1,1

3554,0,Well there is no such issue. I can give you the cover as well with it if you're interested.,6,6
3555,0,Well if the mattress is already used I would definitely at least have to buy a new cover. If the mattress is contaminated then the cover that was being used on it would be too. If I come and pick it up right away and pay in cash could you do $150?,6,6

3581,0,Great then we got a deal,0,0
3582,0,Hello!,0,0
3583,0,Hello. I love the bed and nightstand. Are they brand new?,5,5
3584,0,"This stand has never been used.  It was bought a year ago, and also comes with a queen firm mattress as well if you want that , I can add it.",0,0
3585,0,Oh ok great. What type of wood is it made from?,5,5

3595,0,"It's Fremont.  You can barely get yourself an apartment for $1600 that is centrally located like this.  At the asking price, it's quite a steal.",2,2
3596,0,"I'm sure it is. Money is tight for me, that's all. Will you accept $1920?",7,7
3597,0,"What I can do, is lower the asking price a bit and ask for 1/2 the deposit.  How does $2700 sound with only $1000 deposit.  We can also change it to month-to-month agreement, so you can leave anytime you want.  How does that sound?",6,6
3598,0,I can do $2080 and the regular $2000 deposit price.,4,4
3599,0,$2500 a month / $1000 deposit.  final offer. :),3,3

3606,0,Thanks! Wolud you be willing to accept $875 for it?,4,4
3607,0,afraid we can't possibly go that low. It doesn't even cover our payments.,4,4

3609,0,We might consider $1500 and cover your utilities if all your references check out.,6,6
3610,0,I couldn't do $1500. Would $1350 work for you?,4,4

3695,0,"Nice, is there any way I can get you to go down on the price?",4,4
3696,0,How low are you thinking. I can't go too low because I am wanting someone to take over the payments.,4,4
3697,0,"Ah, I was thinking $1160, I own a grocery store and I'm low on cash right now, but if you accept that I can give you a certificate for $1000 in product.",7,7

3708,0,"Alright. That's a deal, then. Thanks.",0,0

3752,0,Great. Does it ride well?,5,5
3753,0,yes absolutely. Its a great deal,0,0
3754,0,Thanks. One last question. Is the chain in good condition?,5,5
3755,0,Yes absolutely. Its in great condition.,0,0
3756,0,Cool. Would you accept $735 for it?,4,4

3760,0,That's a deal!,0,0
3761,0,Can I ask why you're getting rid of the chair?,1,1

3763,0,"Yeah, I think it would go well in a room in my apartment.",0,0
3764,0,Great! When do you want to come pick it up?,0,0

3767,0,"Honestly, I was thinking somewhere closer to 15-20. Its nice, but I don't *need* it.",4,4
3768,0,Can you do $25?,4,4
3769,0,I think I can make that work.,0,0
3770,0,Sounds good!,0,0
3771,0,"Hi, how big would you say this hutch is?",5,5
3772,0,It is pretty big but beautiful and worth having,0,0
3773,0,How long have you had it?,5,5
3774,0,I had it a few months it is in great condition,0,0
3775,0,Are there any scratches?,1,1
3776,0,No scratches or marks at all,0,0
3777,0,It sounds pretty heavy. I think I can get a truck to pick it up but I need to know about how much it weighs. Would you say it's larger than 3 feet acros and 6 feet high? I guestimate it about 140 pounds,5,5
3778,0,It is about 115 pounds tops,0,0
3779,0,So you think you could let it go for $75?,4,4
3780,0,I would be able to do 100 the most because it is in great condition and pretty much never been used just was for display at home,2,2
3781,0,"Deal, can I pick it up this weekend or do you need to get rid of it right away?",0,0
3782,0,I can hold it for you!,0,0

3784,0,"Yes, I am, actually. I can't see the table top and am wondering what condition the whole set is in.",1,1
3785,0,The table top is not pictured. My husband was cleaning with when I snapped this photo. It is in great condition though!,0,0
3786,0,"Are there any more chairs for the table, or just the four pictured?",5,5
3787,0,Only the ones pictured. I will not fit anymore.,0,0
3788,0,I see. What color is the upholstery?,5,5
3789,0,grey!,0,0
3790,0,"Good color. Since it is a smaller set than I thought, would you be willing to accept $120 for it?",4,4
3791,0,"I can not take that low for it. But, if you are willing to pick up tonight by 7pm I can let it go for 175. but, you must bring help to load it and cash in hand",6,6
3792,0,"I think I can do that, as long as it is in really good condition.",0,0
3793,0,"i assure you, you will not be disappointed",0,0
3794,0,Terrific! $175 it is.,0,0
3795,0,Hello!  Looks like you're in the market for an amplifier!,0,0
3796,0,"Hi, can you tell me how long youu have had the amplifier?",5,5
3797,0,"I've had it a year or so.  We got another one and although we could still use this, we don't need two.",0,0
3798,0,That makes sense. What kind of accessories come with it?,5,5
3799,0,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion.  You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,0,0
3800,0,Great. What brand is it?,5,5
3801,0,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand.  I'm asking $949 which is below market.,0,0
3802,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",7,7
3803,0,Oh my.  That's lower than I anticipated.  How about $900?  Would that work?  I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,6,6
3804,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",7,4
3805,0,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you.  How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",4,4
3806,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",4,4
3807,0,"If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal.",4,4
3808,0,"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",0,0
3809,0,Sounds Great!,0,0
3810,0,"Hey there, I saw that you were interested in the apartment!",0,0
3811,0,"Yes, it looks very nice. Is it furnished?",5,5
3812,0,"It sure is, We just recently remodeled, and included some appliances. We have an AC unit, a fridge, a stove, and a washer and dryer!",0,0
3813,0,Awesome! Are any utilities included like cable or electric?,5,5
3814,0,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.,0,0
3815,0,"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",5,5
3816,0,Municipal city water.,0,0
3817,0,"I know you're asking for $2750, but would you be able to come down closer to $1900?",4,4
3818,0,We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?,4,4
3819,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,4,5
3820,0,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",6,0
3821,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",0,0
3822,0,Excellent. Feel free to call the head office if there is anything else you would need. Enjoy your stay with us!,0,0
3823,0,"Hello, are you interested in my phone?",0,0
3824,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,1,1
3825,0,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,0,0
3826,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,1,1
3827,0,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",0,0
3828,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,4,0
3829,0,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",4,4
3830,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,7,7
3831,0,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",2,0
3832,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,0,0
3833,0,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",0,0
3834,0,Hi. I see your interested in my car?,0,0
3835,0,"Hello, yes I may be interested in purchasing the car. Has it had regular maintenance?",5,5

3837,0,Great. No mechanical issues?,1,1
3838,0,No issues at all.,0,0
3839,0,When were the tires last replaced?,5,0
3840,0,Tires were just replaced and it has new wheels everything is good to go.,0,0
3841,0,Sounds like it may be what I'm looking for. I have 6000 in cash I can give you today for it.,4,4
3842,0,6500 and I will bring the car to you right now.,6,6
3843,0,Sounds like a good deal to me.,0,0
3844,0,Hello,0,0
3845,0,"hi, are you interested in my car?",0,0
3846,0,Yes I am. Can I come by and take a look at it?,0,0
3847,0,You absolutely can! Do you have any questions?,0,0
3848,0,"Yes, is the car in good condition?",5,5

3850,0,Would you be able to lower the price a bit for me?,4,0
3851,0,3800 would be the absolute lowest and I will only do that if you are willing to be here by noon tomorrow. I won't hold it for long for that low of a price.,6,0
3852,0,3800 would work for me. I will be there at noon tomorrow.,0,0
3853,0,okay perfect! see you then!,0,0
3854,0,Hello,0,0
3855,0,"Hi, I saw your posing and I would like to buy your San Lorenzo Home.",0,0
3856,0,"Great. It is a really great home, lots of space and a very nice quiet neighborhood.",0,0
3857,0,That sounds awesome! I see your price is $2600 but that's a little high for me. Would you accept $2340?,7,7
3858,0,"I can negotiate the price, sure. Do you have references, and can you provide a security deposit along with first and last month?",4,0
3859,0,"Yes, I have a few references; some family and friends. I should also be able to provide a security deposit.",0,0
3860,0,If you can provide solid references and have first/last and security we could do $2340 for a short term lease.,6,0
3861,0,"Would I be able to extend it, if in the future I want to?",5,0
3862,0,Yes but the price would have to be renegotiated at that time.,6,6
3863,0,"Ok, that sounds fine. So we have a deal for $2340?",0,0
3864,0,Hey I am interested in renting this place if it is still available?,0,0
3865,0,It sure is as of now anyways,0,0
3866,0,I have 10 classmates and myself and this place would be perfect as it is close to campus.,0,0
3867,0,It sounds like you need all the room you can get. Do you have any questions about it?,0,0
3868,0,Does it include any ammenities?,5,5
3869,0,"Oh absolutely! It is Cable/DSL Ready , 2 blocks from campus and  1.5 blocks from Telegraph avenue, it has 2 full bathrooms, washer/Dryer unit, On-Site office management team and it is a clean well-run apartment building. It has a brand new kitchen as well.",0,0
3870,0,Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water.  We are poor graduate students.,7,7
3871,0,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want.",3,0
3872,0,Okay we will take it.,0,0
3873,0,Awesome! Thank you for everything,0,0

3878,0,I bought it less than 1 year ago but I think it's not much older than that.,0,0
3879,0,Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen.  Would you be interested in it?,4,0
3880,0,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?",5,5
3881,0,as far as I know it does.  The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke.  My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,0,0
3882,0,Can you get those screens repaired?,4,0
3883,0,Yeah it does cost around $75 but the phone is worth around $200,4,0
3884,0,"Oh cool, okay how much are you wanting to pay for the amp and the phone?",0,0
3885,0,well I was thinking with the phone I could add $25 cash.,6,0

3892,0,Would you be willing to come down on the price at all? Would you take $800?,4,0
3893,0,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half.  What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.,6,0
3894,0,I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,6,0
3895,0,Well that is a possibility.  What are your qualifications?,0,0
3896,0,"I have 10+ years of experience in building maintenance, carpentry and electrical work. I also have references.",0,0
3897,0,Ok that sounds good.  These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095.  Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.,6,6

3943,0,You can come see it today. I could return it but do not have time to take it just trying to sell it to someone who needs it.,0,0
3944,0,"Well if I were buying a new bike for full price I'd got to the bike shop and get it with a warranty and knowing that it isn't stolen or something.

4117,0,I can not go that low but I can meet you at $77,4,0
4118,0,Deal!,0,0
4119,0,Hi there!  I'm interested in your '65 Chevelle Malibu.  What are you asking for it?,0,0
4120,0,Hello. My asking price is 13500,0,0
4121,0,That's a bit more than I wanted to spend.  Can you tell me a little more about it?  How many miles?  How long have you owned it?,5,5
4122,0,I have owner it for 6 years now and there are 120k. It was a cruising car,0,0
4123,0,Nice! I'm sure it's a blast to ride around in.  Are you willing to negotiate the price?,4,4
4124,0,I am. What do you have in mind? It is in perfect shape,0,0
4125,0,"Would you be willing to accept $10,000?  I can pay cash.",4,4
4126,0,I can do 10500,0,0
4127,0,That will work for me!,0,0
4128,0,"great. Its yours, Thank you",0,0
4129,0,Hello I was interested in your 2011 fusion hybrid.,0,0
4130,0,Hello. Great! It is a nice little car,0,0
4131,0,"It looks fairly decent, does everything run well? It is a bit pricey for me at the moment. Would you be able to work with me on this price a bit?",4,4
4132,0,"Yes, it is excellent condition with a few minor scratches. What do you have in mind?",0,0
4133,0,I am searching in the ballpark of $5600. I dont know how feasible this would be for you. Maybe we could work out a deal.,4,4
4134,0,Prehaps. I can do 6000.,4,4
4135,0,I could work with 6000.00. When may I meet with you to finalize this?,0,0
4136,0,Tomorrow afternoon,0,0
4137,0,Great Ill see you then.,0,0
4138,0,Thank you,0,0
4139,0,hello,0,0
4140,0,"Hi there, how we doing today?",0,0
4141,0,Very good! yourself?,0,0
4142,0,Doing great thank you for asking.  So you are interested in the solid oak wood antique vanity and dresser?,0,0
4143,0,"I sure am! unlike you, im currently moving into a new place lol. Kind of on a budget at the moment. wondering what the lowest you would take would be.",7,7
4144,0,"The lowest I would be willing to go on the antique solid wood set would be an even $600, and at that price it would be Pick Up Only. Original asking price was listed at $750, and the piece was picked up at an antique store for just shy of $2,000",2,2
4145,0,"I underestand. But the value cant be near it anymore as you and i are currently talking about it at a fraction of the price. Im also interested in picking up the sofa i saw on the other listing as well. Would you consider 450 on the dresser, and if the sofa is in good condition, ill offer you the listing of $200. 2 for 1 deal.",6,6
4146,0,I can toss in the sofa for an additional $50  (as opposed to asking price listed at $90) and deliver all of the items directly to you saving you a bit of gas and time for an even $700? :),6,6
4147,0,Deal!,0,0
4148,0,Hello! Looks like you're in the market for an amplifier!,0,0
4149,0,"Hi, can you tell me how long youu have had the amplifier?",5,5
4150,0,"I've had it a year or so. We got another one and although we could still use this, we don't need two.",0,0
4151,0,That makes sense. What kind of accessories come with it?,5,5
4152,0,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion. You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,0,0
4153,0,Great. What brand is it?,5,5
4154,0,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand. I'm asking $949 which is below market.,0,0
4155,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",7,7
4156,0,Oh my. That's lower than I anticipated. How about $900? Would that work? I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,6,6
4157,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",4,4
4158,0,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you. How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",4,4
4159,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",7,4
4160,0,"If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal.",4,4
4161,0,"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",0,0
4162,0,Sounds Great!,0,0
4163,0,"Hey there, I saw that you were interested in the apartment!",0,0
4164,0,"Yes, it looks very nice. Is it furnished?",5,5
4165,0,"It sure is, We just recently remodeled, and included some appliances. We have an AC unit, a fridge, a stove, and a washer and dryer!",0,0
4166,0,Awesome! Are any utilities included like cable or electric?,5,5
4167,0,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.,0,0
4168,0,"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",5,5
4169,0,Municipal city water.,0,0
4170,0,"I know you're asking for $2750, but would you be able to come down closer to $1900?",4,4
4171,0,We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?,4,4
4172,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,5,5
4173,0,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",0,0
4174,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",0,0
4175,0,Excellent. Feel free to call the head office if there is anything else you would need. Enjoy your stay with us!,0,0
4176,0,"Hello, are you interested in my phone?",0,0
4177,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,0,1
4178,0,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,0,0
4179,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,0,1
4180,0,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",0,0
4181,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,0,0
4182,0,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",0,4
4183,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,0,7
4184,0,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",0,0
4185,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,0,0
4186,0,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",0,0
4187,0,Hi. I see your interested in my car?,0,0
4188,0,"Hello, yes I may be interested in purchasing the car. Has it had regular maintenance?",0,5
4189,0,The transmission has been rebuilt. Has new parts. Everything is in perfect working condition.,0,0
4190,0,Great. No mechanical issues?,0,1
4191,0,No issues at all.,0,0
4192,0,When were the tires last replaced?,0,0
4193,0,Tires were just replaced and it has new wheels everything is good to go.,0,0
4194,0,Sounds like it may be what I'm looking for. I have 6000 in cash I can give you today for it.,0,4
4195,0,6500 and I will bring the car to you right now.,0,6
4196,0,Sounds like a good deal to me.,0,0
4197,0,Hello,0,0
4198,0,"hi, are you interested in my car?",0,0
4199,0,Yes I am. Can I come by and take a look at it?,0,0
4200,0,You absolutely can! Do you have any questions?,0,0
4201,0,"Yes, is the car in good condition?",0,5
4202,0,"The car is in very good condition. My daughter is the one who drives it and she has always been a neat freak. The car is very clean inside and out. Oil changes and tune ups are done every 3,000 miles.",0,0
4203,0,Would you be able to lower the price a bit for me?,0,0
4204,0,3800 would be the absolute lowest and I will only do that if you are willing to be here by noon tomorrow. I won't hold it for long for that low of a price.,0,0
4205,0,3800 would work for me. I will be there at noon tomorrow.,0,0
4206,0,okay perfect! see you then!,0,0
4207,0,Hello,0,0
4208,0,"Hi, I saw your posing and I would like to buy your San Lorenzo Home.",0,0
4209,0,"Great. It is a really great home, lots of space and a very nice quiet neighborhood.",0,0
4210,0,That sounds awesome! I see your price is $2600 but that's a little high for me. Would you accept $2340?,0,7
4211,0,"I can negotiate the price, sure. Do you have references, and can you provide a security deposit along with first and last month?",0,0
4212,0,"Yes, I have a few references; some family and friends. I should also be able to provide a security deposit.",0,0
4213,0,If you can provide solid references and have first/last and security we could do $2340 for a short term lease.,0,0
4214,0,"Would I be able to extend it, if in the future I want to?",0,0
4215,0,Yes but the price would have to be renegotiated at that time.,0,6
4216,0,"Ok, that sounds fine. So we have a deal for $2340?",0,0
4217,0,Hey I am interested in renting this place if it is still available?,0,0
4218,0,It sure is as of now anyways,0,0
4219,0,I have 10 classmates and myself and this place would be perfect as it is close to campus.,0,0
4220,0,It sounds like you need all the room you can get. Do you have any questions about it?,0,0
4221,0,Does it include any ammenities?,0,5
4222,0,"Oh absolutely! It is Cable/DSL Ready , 2 blocks from campus and 1.5 blocks from Telegraph avenue, it has 2 full bathrooms, washer/Dryer unit, On-Site office management team and it is a clean well-run apartment building. It has a brand new kitchen as well.",0,0
4223,0,Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water. We are poor graduate students.,0,7
4224,0,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want.",0,0
4225,0,Okay we will take it.,0,0
4226,0,Awesome! Thank you for everything,0,0
4227,0,Hi how are you?,0,0
4228,0,Im doing great. How are you? I am very interested in your amp is it still available?,0,0
4229,0,"Oh great, yes it is do you have any concerns?",0,0
4230,0,how old is it?,0,0
4231,0,I bought it less than 1 year ago but I think it's not much older than that.,0,0
4232,0,Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone. I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen. Would you be interested in it?,0,0
4233,0,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?",0,5
4234,0,as far as I know it does. The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke. My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,0,0
4235,0,Can you get those screens repaired?,0,0
4236,0,Yeah it does cost around $75 but the phone is worth around $200,0,0
4237,0,"Oh cool, okay how much are you wanting to pay for the amp and the phone?",0,0
4238,0,well I was thinking with the phone I could add $25 cash.,0,0
4239,0,"That seems like a good deal to me, thank you!",0,0
4240,0,Hello how are you today?,0,0
4241,0,"Hello, I am doing great. How are you? I am interested in the apartment on Bassett Dr. Is it still available?",0,0
4242,0,Yes it sure it.,0,0
4243,0,Has it been remodeled recently? Is it close to shops?,0,0
4244,0,"Yes we actually just remodeled it this past month so everything is brand new. The location is perfect, it is a quiet residential neighboorhood but you are just a 5 minute walk from many local shops.",0,0
4245,0,Would you be willing to come down on the price at all? Would you take $800?,0,0
4246,0,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half. What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.,0,0
4247,0,I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,0,0
4248,0,Well that is a possibility. What are your qualifications?,0,0
4249,0,"I have 10+ years of experience in building maintenance, carpentry and electrical work. I also have references.",0,0
4250,0,Ok that sounds good. These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095. Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.,0,6
4251,0,"That sounds great, Thank you.",0,0
4252,0,hello,0,0

4257,0,Drop it off? I am not sure about that,0,0
4258,0,"ok, i can pick it up if the price is somewhat negotiable",0,6
4259,0,The price is a fantastic $18-,0,0

4267,0,Oh great. Can i offer you $40 then since its not a new one,2,2

4274,0,It's a cute home. Layout is easy and open.,0,0
4275,0,"I have seen the picture, and yes. It is indeed a very cute home! I was wondering if we could work out a little deal though. I was wanting something a little closer to $3000, this home is just out of my range.",7,7
4276,0,"This home has all new stainless steel appliances, a new central air system and a screened-in back porch. I could possibly go down to $3200.",2,2
4277,0,"Its all sounding good, but I am still just short of that. If we could work out $3100, I could move in this week!",6,6
4278,0,Would you be willing to sign a year lease?,6,6
4279,0,Ofcorse!,0,0
4280,0,Okay. I'll go ahead with $3100 a month signing a 1 year lease.,0,0
4281,0,"What a lovely house! I wonder, how high up is it? I'm afraid of heights.",0,5

4283,0,Oh that's not so bad then. I see you have an updated kitchen and bathrooms? Did you use tile and what does the color scheme look like?,0,5
4284,0,We've had a decorator come and in and it has a very modern feel to it. The kitchen and bathrooms have been updated. The backyard is enclosed for privacy. I am asking $4995.,0,0
4285,0,"That is my only concern, it's a little high. I am contractor, I could keep the grounds in order for you if you can come down to...$4200?",0,6
4286,0,"If you are offering to tend to the grounds, there is not much of it, I could come down to $4500",0,0
4287,0,"I'm sure you have other properties where I can help out, $4300?",0,0
4288,0,"That is the only property I have at the moment. Because of all the upgrades I have done, I am already giving you a great deal by bringing it down to $4500",0,0
4289,0,"I'm sorry, but I can't squeeze blood from a stone. $4350 is the absolute most I can afford.",0,7
4290,0,I can do $4450 if you can move in by the first with a deposit.,0,0
4291,0,Can I sublet a bedroom and rent my space?,0,0
4292,0,"Yes, you may.",0,0
4293,0,"$4450, yeah I can come up with that. You have a deal.",0,0

4304,0,It was manufactured in 2015. I have only had it for a year and used it for a few months.,0,0
4305,0,Oh great. Did you experience any problem with it and is it still under warranty?,1,1
4306,0,It is still under warranty. No issues at all. I am asking $100 for it as it is in almost new condition.,0,0
4307,0,Okay that's a good one. Can i offer you $70 then because its still under warranty,4,4
4308,0,The lowest I can let it go for is $90. It has barely been used. There are on issues with it.,2,2

4318,0,"Ok I see one of them is power motion, does that work? I can offer $495",4,4

5209,0,"Hi, I'm interested in the couch you have for sale",0,0
5210,0,Great!,0,0
5211,0,It looks like a great couch but the price is rather high for me.,7,7
5212,0,"Well,it is unbelievably comfortable.It just clashed with my other furniture.I can maybe go down a little?",0,0
5213,0,"I was hoping to pay maybe half if possible, ideally. That seems like a good price for a used couch.",2,2
5214,0,I wouldn't call it used.I think it was sat on twice so the price listed is practically a steal!How about $950?,2,2
5215,0,"Hmm. I could go $600, how about that? By the way is the couch easy to disassemble, or does it have to be moved intact? I'm thinking about how easily it could be transported.",4,4
5216,0,"Hello, Do you have any interest in my couch for sale?",0,0
5217,0,"Yes, I think it is a quite attractive couch, although that is a lot of money for me right now. I was hoping to pay maybe half of what you're asking--what do you think?",2,2
5218,0,You are right about it being attractive! Give me a price and I will see what I can do.,0,0
5219,0,"Well, how about $500? I know it's much less than you are asking for, but I'd be giving it a great home!",6,6
5220,0,"I'd love for it to have a great home, but I need to have a home too! LoL! How about $850?",4,4
5221,0,"Oh, we're definitely moving in the right direction! That's still a bit steep for me but...well...I really like that it is made from largely recycled materials. How about $600? By the way can this couch be easily dissasembled for transport? If not I'm probably going to have to rent a small moving truck.",7,7
5222,0,"Tell you what. I will deliver it to you assembled at no extra charge.Plus, I'll even throw in two free throw pillows all for $825.Oh yes, it is made from recycled materials.That is a wonderful thing!",6,6
5223,0,Thanks for offering to deliver it assembled if we can come to an agreement--that will make it much easier on my end. It's still a bit pricey for me. How about $725?,4,4
5224,0,"If you factor in the price of a moving truck with my offer it is a steal!You'd be paying less with my deal,but since I feel you truly love this couch I will drop it down to $800 and still provide my additional services!",0,0
5225,0,"Well...that is more than I can comfortably pay but it is a very attractive couch and since you're offering to set it up, I will accept your offer of $800.",0,0
5226,0,Great! You won't be sorry. Let's get this transaction started! Thank you!,0,0
5227,0,hi,0,0
5228,0,"Hi, this bike is great! I would like to offer you 510 dollars for it.",4,4

5230,0,Are you willing to accept my offer? I'm willing to pick up the item myself.,6,6
5231,0,that's a little low for me i got to much in it for that price,4,4
5232,0,How about 650?,4,4
5233,0,"i would consider $750 if you came and pick it up, can't let it go any cheaper sorry.",6,6
5234,0,"Okay, I can agree with that.",0,0
5235,0,what time would you like to pick it up,0,0
5236,0,How about tomorrow afternoon?,0,0

5249,0,"No the stool is all black, very sleek",0,0

5252,0,Nice. Even better. Could you accept $6?,4,4
5253,0,Yes I could do $6. Enjoy your chair!,0,0
5254,0,Hey so I'm interested in the bike you have for sale. Can you tell me about it?,5,5
5255,0,"Sure thing. Frame is 17 Inches. Comes with a 3-speed Shimano nexus shifter. It works fine, but a tune-up and some new tires would help its performance greatly.",0,0
5256,0,"Woah, that sounds like it needs a lot of stuff. What kind of condition is it in?",5,5
5257,0,"Again, it's in great working condition. It doesn't need those things that I mentioned, but they would help.",0,0
5258,0,So can you deliver it?,6,6
5259,0,Sure. That won't be a problem. Will you be willing to pay the listed price for it?,0,0
5260,0,"Absolutely not, I'm thinking more $40. It needs another $100 in work.",2,2
5261,0,"That's a fair point, but $40 is too low for me. I'll go up to $65 for it, and won't charge extra for the delivery.",6,6
5262,0,I'll meet you in the middle and pick it up at 52,6,6
5263,0,That'll do fine.,0,0
5264,0,thanks,0,0

5289,0,Was there a chain guard with the bike?,5,5
5290,0,"No there isn't, she's an older gal.",0,0
5291,0,Would you do fifty?,4,4
5292,0,"I was planning on selling it for around $150, used to ride a lot and kept the bike well maintained. New job and everything so haven't really had the chance to ride anymore. Since the chain guard is missing I'd be happy to go down to $100",2,2
5293,0,"It would be just parts for me, $50 is all it is worth to me.",2,2
5294,0,Eh afraid I can't do that. If you'd come pick it up I'd do $75 to save myself the hassle,6,6
5295,0,"OK, I can pick it up. $75.00",0,0
5296,0,Hi!,0,0
5297,0,Hello. How are you?,0,0

5307,0,"Hi,I see you are interested. How can I help you?",0,0
5308,0,Does it have a parking space and can you tell me a little bit about the area?,5,5
5309,0,It does have parking space and is located right near good restuants. It is located not to far from the beach as well.,0,0
5310,0,Oh nice! Is the area safe?,1,1
5311,0,Very safe. What kind of price are you looking to pay me?,0,0
5312,0,How about 800?,4,4
5313,0,"How about $950 and I will throw in free cable,internet and ac?",6,6

5323,0,I have a little wiggle room. What are you willing to pay?,0,0
5324,0,$2300 would be a great price point for me.,4,4
5325,0,I don't think I can go that low. The bike still has 2 years full warranty left on it. I could probably do $2500 if you picked it up,2,2
5326,0,I could do 2500 but only if you include the pedals.,6,6
5327,0,"Yes, it includes a spare set of pedals. You have a deal",0,0
5328,0,Hi!,0,0
5329,0,hi,0,0

5331,0,Yes.,0,0
5332,0,Perfect! I can give you an amazing deal on this bike! Do you have any questions?,0,0
5333,0,It looks like it needs a new inner tube,1,1
5334,0,Ok that can be done! How much are you willing to buy the bike for?,0,0
5335,0,$55 dollars,4,4
5336,0,That is extremely low. The bike is basically new and has a great finishe,2,2
5337,0,It's a used bike that needs a new tube.  I can give you $60,2,2
5338,0,Ok that sounds like a deal. One condition is that you must come and pick the bike up!,6,6
5339,0,That sounds fair.,0,0
5340,0,"Hi, I'm interested in your indoor bike",0,0
5341,0,"Great, it is in excellent condition. I had a leg injury and I really couldn't use it after I bought it.",0,0
5342,0,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, I wondered if anything is wrong with it.  So it is in working order and you just can't use it due to your injury?",5,1
5343,0,"Yes, there is nothing wrong with it at all. I have all manual for it also. I also can put the mat that I bought to go under it with it. I'd like to get $150",6,6
5344,0,"Oh, I must have read the ad wrong I thought you were asking $125?  So is your price negotiable at all?",4,4
5345,0,"Oh, I'm sorry I forgot that I changed my mind at the last second and listed it at $125. They are 319 originally.",0,0
5346,0,"Oh ok, would you come down to $75? I have cash and could come get it tonight.",6,6
5347,0,I can't go that low. I would come down to $135 if you pick it up tonight but no Mat.,6,6
5348,0,That is more than your ad says...I could do $100 and  I don't need the mat.,6,6
5349,0,"Sorry, that was supposed to be $105.00. I'll go $100.00. See you tonight then.",0,0
5350,0,"Hi, I saw these lights for sale?",0,0
5351,0,Yes may I answer any questions you have?,0,0
5352,0,What condition are they in?,5,5
5353,0,These are used but in very good condition.,0,0
5354,0,How long are they?,5,5
5355,0,They are long but not wide. They rest comfortably on the back of a standard workbench comfortably. They take up the whole length of the bench.,0,0
5356,0,"Okay well, I could use a pair of these for setting different plastics, I would like to pay $54",4,4
5357,0,As these are in good shape I would be willing to let them go for $80.,2,2
5358,0,"If you'll come down to $75, I'll pick them up tonight.",6,6
5359,0,I would do that.,0,0
5360,0,"Okay sounds great, I'll be by your house tonight :)",0,0
5361,0,It's a nice drone in a perfect condition. make an offer.,0,0
5362,0,"Hello, I would like to pay $400. Would that work for you?",4,4
5363,0,"nope. That's way too low, man. At most, i could probably knock off a hundred off the price. so 650. But really that's the most I can do",3,3
5364,0,"Are there other offers currently? I have seen a similar product available for $500, but it's farther away so I wanted to make a deal",2,2
5365,0,"There are a plenty of other drones for that price. some will be new too, but they won't be DJI phatom 4. You're paying for quality here my friend.",2,2
5366,0,$500 is the highest I can go,3,3
5367,0,"tell you what. 600, and you have your drone. a perfect condition. phantom 4.  deal?",3,3
5368,0,"Unfortunately I do not have enough available for that, I could round up some cash to hit $535?",7,7
5369,0,I can't do that. Sorry. 600 really is the lowest. Maybe this drone isn't for you,3,3
5370,0,"Yeah I will look elsewhere, thanks for your time",0,0
5371,0,no problem good luck,0,0
5372,0,Hello.,0,0
5373,0,"Hello, I am interested in the bike.",0,0
5374,0,Okay. Are you willing to pay the listed price?,0,0
5375,0,"No, that is a bit out of my price range for a used bike.  Are you willing to go lower?",2,2
5376,0,I could part with these components for $1900 with a free delivery to you.,6,6
5377,0,I'm worried about the tires condition after the 1000 miles.  How about $1800?  Or new tires and $1850?,2,2
5378,0,I could throw in new tires and a free delivery for $1875. Does that sound fair?,6,6
5379,0,Sounds fair!,0,0
5380,0,Deal!,0,0
5381,0,Deal!,0,0
5382,0,Hi!,0,0
5383,0,Hello. Any questions about the sofa?,0,0
5384,0,"Yes, was wondering how the condition of the sofa is. I've seen pictures and it doesn't seem as new",1,1
5385,0,It's in very good condition. We are a smoke-free house and don't own pets.,0,0
5386,0,"Ok, nice. And how much did you buy it for?",5,5
5387,0,I paid $600 for the set two years ago.,0,0
5388,0,"Ok, great. I was thinking maybe $280",4,4
5389,0,$300 and I'll throw in the ottoman we used with the loveseat.,6,6
5390,0,Sounds excellent!,0,0
5391,0,Great. Thanks for not low-balling the offer.,0,0
5392,0,Hi,0,0
5393,0,"Hi, Why are there so few pictures for this item?",1,1
5394,0,I just have had some issues with my camera,0,0
5395,0,Got it. So what's your favorite thing about this car?,5,5
5396,0,"I think the smooth ride and handling, also the color is great , pearl white.",0,0
5397,0,Okay. That's good to hear. What do you think about $5000 even for it. Of course you know that you priced it a bit high.,4,4
5398,0,I researched and that is more than fair market value. I am willing to lower it but feel 5000 is too low.,2,2
5399,0,"Well, it's a used car without a warranty. I can go a little bit higher than 5k, but I need a warranty.",6,6
5400,0,"you are mistaken, there is a warranty.",2,2
5401,0,What's the warranty? I don't see it in your advertisement,4,4
5402,0,"It is a manufacturer warranty, good for 5 more years..",0,0
5403,0,"Okay, well in that case, I feel quite a bit better about the fact that there aren't any pictures. How about an even 6000? I am going up a whole thousand more than I want to pay here, please budge for me!!!",7,7
5404,0,alright for you I can do 6000.,0,0
5405,0,FANTASTIC!!!,0,0
5406,0,Are you interested in the house?,0,0
5407,0,I am but was wondering about the location. What is that close to?,5,5
5408,0,"This home is located in a great part of town.  It is on a quiet cul de sac, but walking distance to the town center with shops and restaurants.  It is a safe walk too.  Lined with brand-new sidewalks all the way.",0,0
5409,0,I wish you accepted pets and had a washer/dryer. Would you be willing to go $2200?,2,2
5410,0,"No, sorry, too low.  There is a washer/dryer hook up.",2,2
5411,0,I don't have a washer or dryer. The place I'm at now included it. Who takes care of the lawn/landscaping?,5,5
5412,0,We have a service comes once a month for the lawn and bushes.,0,0
5413,0,I could go $2500 if you can include a washer/dryer but that's the best I can do.,6,6
5414,0,"I have a couple coming to view the property today.  If you could do 2800 the property is yours, but otherwise I'll have to wait until after the viewing.",4,4
5415,0,I can do $2600 with the washer/dryer but that is a stretch.,6,6
5416,0,I have other business to tend to so I'll tell you what...I'll take 2600 but no washer dryer.,6,6
5417,0,$2550 and that will leave me enough to rent a washer/dryer?,2,2

5420,0,"yes hi , it's a perfect bike",0,0

5423,0,What are you asking?,5,5
5424,0,I ll let it go for 2600,0,0
5425,0,Are the tires in good shape?,1,1
5426,0,yes they are in perfect shape,0,0
5427,0,Will you take 2000?,4,4
5428,0,"I will take 2400 and I will deliver it , how about that ?",6,6
5429,0,Will you do 2200 and I will come pick it up since its a 100 mile drive?  It will save you on gas.,6,6
5430,0,"i think i could that, only if you come tomorrow morning, because i might change my mind,fair enough ?",6,6
5431,0,Good deal. agree,0,0

5438,0,I've listed these for 15 but I can negotiate. How about 13?,4,4
5439,0,"i think I will accept 13 only if you ship it to my address and you pay the two dollars shipping and handling, fair enough ?",6,6
5440,0,Yeah that sounds fair. I3 and I'll ship them to you today.,0,0
5441,0,nice doing business with you,0,0
5442,0,how we doing today,0,0
5443,0,"Hi, I am interested in your tahoe. can you tell me anything i need to know about this car",5,5
5444,0,"it's my second tahoe, I like it but I don't need it anymore, it has all the luxuries inside and great for long distance,  no rips, new tires",0,0
5445,0,how long have you personally owned this vehicle,5,5
5446,0,10 years,0,0
5447,0,"okay, great. I did not see in the ad, is this a manual or automatic?",5,5
5448,0,"automatic , it's really great",0,0
5449,0,"perfect. I am very interested in purchasing this vehicle, since this is a car you no longer need and since it is such high mileage are you willing to negotiate on the price. The listed price is just a little above my budget.",7,7
5450,0,"ok we can work something out, what can you do",0,0
5451,0,I'm concerned about any repairs and maintenance that I may have to do. I'm looking closer to the 2100.00 price range,2,2
5452,0,"yeah it went for a full check up and it runs great, o you ok on that, but 2100 is way out of my range",2,2
5453,0,"I'm not sure If I can do much more, while it looks great I would need to be able to take the car to a mechanic that I trust in order to go much higher than this. Without the most I could go is 2500",2,2
5454,0,"ok it's you lucky day, but you have to come an pick it up, and cash only please, fair enough ?",6,6
5455,0,"I can do cash, can we meet in the middle?",4,4
5456,0,Good morning.  Can you tell me about the mountain bike you have listed?,0,0
5457,0,"Sure. Shame to let it go because of how much I love it, but it's great if you wanna go downhill. It has a raceface handlebars and stem evolve, WTB seat, moto and cranks and Maxxis high roller tires.",0,0
5458,0,How long have you owned it for?   Are you the original owner?,5,5
5459,0,"That's right. It's mine only, and I've owned for about a few months give or take, so it's not in the worst condition at all. How much are we willing to negotiate?",0,0
5460,0,"Well, $800 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $650 if I were to come and pick it up?  Might save you a little bit of hassle....",6,6
5461,0,That s a lot lower than I hoped it would be. I want to sell it for $775 because of how close it is to that of a brand new bike in terms of quality.,2,2
5462,0,Hmmm....How about $725?,4,4
5463,0,"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?",4,4
5464,0,Yeah.  OK.  I'll do $750 if you're willing to deliver it to me.  How about that?,6,6
5465,0,I'm willing to deliver to you! Sounds good to me!,0,0
5466,0,"Hello, I am interested in the cabinets you have listed.",0,0
5467,0,"Hi, the cabinets are brand new and unopened - they're great, but just don't fit in my kitchen.",0,0
5468,0,How long have you had them?,5,5
5469,0,"I bought them about 3 months ago, and still have the receipts.",0,0
5470,0,Okay. Do you know if Home Depot can still special order these cabinets?,5,5
5471,0,"Yes, they still carry the line so you should still be able to order them.",0,0
5472,0,"Okay, great! I am actually looking for four of them. Does this come with the hardware for them as well?",5,5
5473,0,"I have the hardware I purchased for them that I would be willing to throw in, I just need the space and to get these out of here!",0,0
5474,0,"Okay, I am very interested in the cabinets. You are a little bit of a drive for me, would you be willing to negotiate on the price a bit?",4,4

5476,0,"I'm actually not, I am about 42 miles one way.",0,0
5477,0,"Okay, I could go down to $70 - they are already quite discounted, and I will include the hardware.",6,6
5478,0,Would you be willing to do $65,4,4
5479,0,"Not with the hardware included, $70 is as low as I can go.",3,3

5485,0,Can you tell me anything about it,0,0
5486,0,"I am the original owner, bought it new in 2006.  Great vehicle - has never left me stranded.  The interior is nearly pristine and the exterior looks very good (some dings like you would expect from an 11 year old vehicle).  Still drives great.  Only 85,000 miles.",0,0
5487,0,"Ok, how much are you asking?",5,5

5489,0,"Ok, I will offer you 4600 for it.",4,4
5490,0,"Uh, no.  Book on it is $8300.  I'm already below that.  I'd be willing to consider an offer that is more reasonable, but $4600 is over three-thousand below my asking price.",2,2
5491,0,Well to be honest I found the same care with less miles for cheaper.  If oyu are willing to throw in a warranty and deliver it for me I will offer more.,6,6
5492,0,"OK, I can offer a 1 year warranty and will bring it to you, but I need you to make an offer.",6,6

5501,0,"Ok, well, it is in great condition, but I am willing to bargain",2,2
5502,0,Okay. I can take it off your hands today for 300. I can pick it up myself.,6,6

5638,0,"I'm interested, but $650 is what AT&T charges for the phone new from the store. For that price I get a warranty and know for sure that it's never been dropped, used, stolen, etc. Would you consider selling it for $400? I checked online and that seems to be the going rate.",2,2

5667,0,"Cool. I would love to purchase the car from you, but $4900 is a little much for me. I really only have $3400 to spend. Are you willing to come down on the price?",7,7
5668,0,I understand your situation but unfortunately I can only come down to $4500.,3,3
5669,0,"Oh no! I would be able to do maybe $3800, but that't my limit, I'm afraid. I can come pick it up wherever! I'll even bring you some cupcakes!\",6,6

5707,0,"Nice, the only reason I ask is because i'm looking at the photo and the leather looks like it's sagging a bit. I mean it shouldn't be a huge deal but it'll cost me out of pocket to get it refitted. could you possibly accept $200 for the sofa and loveseat?",2,2
5708,0,"They are genuine leather, and they truly are in very good condition. $200 is a bit too low. The lowest I want to go is $280.",2,2

5720,0,I just bought a new car when this one started acting up and need it gone as I have no use for it anymore.,0,0
5721,0,"Acting up with only 50,000 miles, you must be a mechanic. Well, I'll give you 6300",2,2

5730,0,"That is still too high for me. I am about to start at the local university, and all I have is $140 to spend",7,7
5731,0,"Oh wow, that is substantially lower than what I'd like to sell it for. If I do $140 will you help me move into my new apartment? It should only take 3 hours and I have a moving truck but nobody to help.",6,6
5732,0,I absolutely can! sounds like a great deal!,0,0
5733,0,"Wow, awesome!",0,0

5741,0,Can you do it for $600,4,4
5742,0,600 would be way too low for me. I suppose I could knock the price down just a hair if you can get here quick. How does $1100 sound?,6,6

6600,0,"Oh, I see what you meant. I don't think there is that much going on at night in downtown Walnut Creek, but I could be wrong. I could come down a little, but $1190 is a bit low. How about $1400, and I'll pay the utility bills?",6,0
6601,0,That's still a little out of my range but how does $1300 sound?,7,0
6602,0,"If you sign a two year lease, I'll do $1300.",6,0

6811,0,How many times was the bed used?,5,0
6812,0,"We basically took ours off and put this on, but she decided after a nights sleep on it, that she preferred ours better.",0,0
6813,0,Is it the latest model?,5,0
6814,0,"Yes..  Cost well over $2,000..",0,0
6815,0,Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,1,0
6816,0,"I just want it out of here.  I figured if I asked more than that, that it wouldn't sell quickly.  I don't have the space to continue to store it and I will deliver for free..",0,0

7367,0,Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,0,0
