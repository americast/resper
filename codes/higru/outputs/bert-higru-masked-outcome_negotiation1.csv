539,0,"That's closer, but I still think $1400 would be a more fair price. I forgot to mention another great benefit of this rental.

541,0,"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",6,2,1,0.6692493557929993
