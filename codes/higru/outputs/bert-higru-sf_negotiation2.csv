25,0,It is a great car. It runs great. I'm asking $4000.,0,0
26,0,"That's way out of my budget, plus it seems a bit steep for such an old car.",2,2

29,0,I'm going to get a motorcycle instead. How much are you willing to pay?,0,0
30,0,"I'm very interested, but it's out of my price point. I'd like to pay around 2,500 for my next car.",4,4

32,0,"I could go up to $3,000",4,4
33,0,How about $3400?,4,4
34,0,"Believe me, I wish I had that much saved. The absolute highest I could go is $3,200",7,3
35,0,"No, too low. I'm close to the Blue Book value. If you pay $3400 and something goes wrong in the next three months, I'll refund your money. You rarely get a warranty like tha!",6,6

70,0,"Hello, yes. The rent is $2698 monthly with all the included amenities.",0,0
71,0,"I have to admit, that stretches my budget to a point of discomfort. I'm not sold on the location. I'll have a bit of a commute.",7,7
72,0,"If it helps a bit, the apartment would be fully furnished. It really is a great deal especially for the location you will be in.",2,0
73,0,I don't doubt it. Any chance you'd like to make my day and let me in for 1500?,4,7
74,0,That is incredibly low and I have other people who are interested. The best offer I could give you would be $2450.,3,3

76,0,"That is not a problem. Well firstly, it is a quiet location. You could be downtown in about 5 minutes just walking. I didn't ask if you have pets. You would have a private yard for them to roam around in. We have a fitness center so you can keep up with your fitness goals. Our entire property was also recently renovated.",0,0
77,0,You're an excellent salesperson. 2200?,4,0
78,0,I appreciate that. I can do $2375.,4,4

113,0,"Oh, that's great. Could you come down to $92 for it?",4,4
114,0,"$92,  Yeah I think I could do that for you.",0,0
115,0,"Awesome, thank you!",0,0
116,0,"Hello, I am interested in your product.",0,0
117,0,Hi there,0,0
118,0,Is your sofa in good shape,5,0
119,0,It is used but in good condition,0,0
120,0,"Ok good, do you think it is better for sleeping or just relaxing?",5,5
121,0,You can use it as a sofa and convert it into a sleeper. I love it but I am moving to another state and I can't bring it with me,0,0
122,0,Oh ok.,0,0
123,0,I'm selling it for 40. nice price,0,0
124,0,Do you think you can go a little lower?,4,4
125,0,hmm Can you pick it up before saturday?,6,6
126,0,Yes.,0,0
127,0,How about 30?,4,4
128,0,That sounds good.,0,0
129,0,Great! I'll see you soom,0,0
130,0,Hi there. I was looking for ads and this one caught my attention. Is it in a good and working condition?,5,1
131,0,"It is, it's been used a lot less than its age would suggest. I only rode it a few times a month. Are you interested?",0,0
132,0,Yes very much so.,0,0
133,0,"What's your price point? It's clearly stylish, how does 950 sound?",0,0
134,0,That's way high for me. I have a budget of $760,4,7
135,0,"I'd already be giving you a discount if we went to 900, she's really a beauty",2,4
136,0,That doesn't fit into my budget at all.,7,7
137,0,875 then? I can't go down to 760.,3,4
138,0,Yeah that sounds like a fair deal.,0,0
139,0,Thank you,0,0
140,0,I am interested in your bike. It does seem to be priced quite high. Is there room for negotiation?,0,4
141,0,"yes, there is some wiggle room.",0,0
142,0,Great. Is there anything wrong with the bike?,1,1
143,0,"Nope, I have put some work into it, so it is in great condition.",0,0
144,0,Great! Would you be willing to take $100?,4,4
145,0,"No, that is too low. How about $225?",3,4
146,0,How about $125,4,4
147,0,I can't do that. How about $175?,4,4
148,0,If I pick it up today with cash would you do $140?,6,6
149,0,I suppose we could make that work.,0,0
150,0,Hi! I am willing to sell this bike at a great price are you interested?,0,0
151,0,"Yes, I am very interested! It looks like a beautiful bike.",0,0
152,0,Ok cool! The bike has very low miles and has and upgraded WTB saddle! It also has carbon blade forks and 105 brakes. I am willing to sell for as low as $750.,0,0
153,0,$750 seems a little steep since the bike already has some miles on it. Would you accept $400?,2,2
154,0,$595 is the lowest for a fact!,3,4
155,0,"$595 is a little high for my budget. Are there any accessories you'd be willing to throw in--for instance, a basket, lights, and/or bike pump? That would make it a lot more appealing for me.",6,7
156,0,"I will throw in my 700c wheelset, instead of the standard wheelset. How about that!",6,0
157,0,"I am excited for the 700c wheelset, but it looks like that was already listed in the ad. Is there anything else you can include?",5,2
158,0,Nothing unfortunately. How about 550 and we can call it a night!,4,6
159,0,"That sounds pretty reasonable. Before we make the final agreement, could you just let me know roughly how may miles are on the bike?",5,5
160,0,Well I bought the bike from someone else and have not used it. He did not specify on the miles but just said that it was very low!,0,0
161,0,"Hmm--the ad says that you bought it new. Since you actually bought it (lightly) used from someone else, can we lower the price to $450?",2,2
162,0,Sounds good!,0,0
163,0,Hi,0,0
164,0,Heyu,0,0
165,0,I am interested. Is parking included?,5,5
166,0,"Yes, but only two spots per lease.",0,0
167,0,"fair enough, what is your pet policy?",5,5
168,0,"$30 per pet, and they have to be fixed. 5 max pets per lease.",0,0
169,0,"ok, I just have a cat.",0,0
170,0,That'd be fine. We ask for $2311 a month.,0,0
171,0,any chance you could do it for 1800? I only need one parking space.,2,4
172,0,"I wish, but for some reason you want to live in California near the bay. Everything's way more expensive here. We offer 2 pools, so you can urinate in one and move to the next.",2,0
173,0,"Well you must be very busy , your response time is very slow.  I am willing to come up to $2000.",1,4
174,0,"Sorry, that must be the service. Can you do $2200 and I'll give you a month free.",6,6
175,0,"okay I suppose that is fair.sorry to harp on you , probably the connection.",0,0
176,0,Hi,0,0
177,0,Hello how are you today?,0,0
178,0,good thanks. I am wondering how old your bike is?,5,5
179,0,My bike is only one year old and its in an excellent condition,0,0
180,0,"Great, do you know if they are all terrain tires?",5,5
181,0,Yes they are,0,0
182,0,"great, I am hoping we could make a deal.. I was thinking I can do a cash offer of 304",6,4
183,0,That's too less for me. I can give it to you for $350,4,4
184,0,If you can deliver it I can do 350.,6,6
185,0,Yes I can do that for you!,0,0
186,0,Hi!  I am interested in your bike.  How long have you had it?,5,5
187,0,I'm glad you're interested. We've only had it for about 6 months. It only has about 50 miles on it!,0,0
188,0,"That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try.",7,7
189,0,"Well my wife has definitely enjoyed it, so if yours is like mine I'm sure she will too! I've listed this at $1100 and I expect it to go quickly.",0,0
190,0,"I won't argue that it is a decent price.  Just wondering, is there anything wrong with it?  Seems like a lot to spend on a bike that only has 50 miles of usage...",1,2
191,0,I'm not aware of anything wrong with it - unless you count the fact that it's taking up space in my garage that I'd like to use for other things!,0,0
192,0,"Well, I would love to take it off of your hands at $800.  I'll throw in a birthday party invite. lol",6,6
193,0,"If you can make it $900 and pick it up today, I think we can make a deal",6,6
194,0,$900.  I think we have a deal!,0,0
195,0,Fantastic!,0,0
196,0,"Hey there, you're interested in one of these cell phone batteries?",0,0
197,0,"Hello, are these batteries used?",5,0
198,0,"Nope, I couldn't sell them if they were used, we're a third-party distributor of excess batteries.",0,0
199,0,Okay and how many batteries are you selling for $10?,5,4
200,0,"Oh, it's 1 for 10, but if you want multiple we can sell at a discount for bulk",6,4
201,0,"Thanks but I only need the one battery. And since this is an older model, would you accept $5 for it?",2,2
202,0,"No, we need 8 to at least break even",4,4
203,0,If I pay $8 can you throw in a phone case?,6,6
204,0,"Oh, yes I have a spare right here.",0,0
205,0,That sounds good. I'll take it for $8,0,0
206,0,Hello is the Kia Rio still available?,0,0
207,0,"Yes, it is. I am selling it for $3500.",0,0
208,0,I can offer 2700.00,4,4
209,0,"That is a too low. The car has very low miles on it, and it has always been serviced at the dealer.",2,2
210,0,Yes but it is only a kia and is 13 years old.,2,2
211,0,"True, but it is in great condition. The title is clean, and it has never been in an accident. I will be willing to sell it for $3000.",2,2
212,0,2900 and we have a deal.,3,3
213,0,$2950 and I will even drive it to you.,6,6
214,0,with a full tank of gas?,6,6
215,0,Why not? It even had an oil change last week.,0,0
216,0,Hello,0,0
217,0,Hello there. I was wondering if I would be able to stop by and check this house out to see the inside,5,0
218,0,"Sure, you can come by anytime after 1 pm tomorrow. How much are you hoping to spend on this?",0,0
219,0,"I am looking to pay around 1350, are you willing to lower the price you are asking?",4,4
220,0,"Yes, but 1350 seems a bit too much for me to lower it. Does 2300 work for you?",4,4
221,0,"Well it is fully furnished, right?",5,5
222,0,Yes it is. It also has Comcast cable with all channels and you get house cleaning twice per month.,2,0
223,0,Okay that is a lot so I would be good with paying 2300,0,4
224,0,"Okay. So, do we have a deal?",0,0
225,0,Yup!,0,0
226,0,Good doing business with you.,0,0
227,0,"Hello, interest in my bike?",0,0
228,0,Hey hows it going i have interest,0,0
229,0,I'm asking $250 but the price is negotiable,0,0
230,0,OK Thats good to hear. I really like the bike but i think $250 would have been a fair price about 5 years ago :/,2,4
231,0,"Lol  hey!  vintage is in!!  Ok, since you're being a good sport how does 200 sound?",4,4
232,0,"its a little bit out of my price range still, I really need the bike to get to my new job. I have $125 to spare but i can walk to pick it up from you if that helps?? We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up",6,6
233,0,"I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150",4,3
234,0,I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :),7,6
235,0,"You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!",7,2
236,0,"Ahh make me one more compromise, i know im the worst. i can scrounge an extra 15 up, how about 140?",7,4
237,0,ok you drive a hard bargain.  please remember to pay it forward.  $140 - sold to the whinney person over there!  lol,0,0
238,0,"You are the best :) Thank you this is super helpful for me, see you soon!",0,0
239,0,"Hello, are you interested in leasing my apartment?",0,0
240,0,Yes.  I would like to know something about it.  What's the sq ft and how many bedrooms?,5,5
241,0,"sure.  1 bdrm, 1 bath approx. 65 sq ft",0,0
242,0,65 sq ft?  Is it more like a studio?,5,5
243,0,sorry...that s/h been 565.  This is an excellent apartment complex.  Too many amenities to list but I will guarantee you would find everything you are looking for here.,0,0
244,0,The price is a little high for me?  Would you be willing to come down?,4,4
245,0,I understand.  I can come down a little but I will not be able to honor the $500 off move in.  What price range did you have in mind?,0,6
246,0,"$1500.  Of course, if utilities are covered and there is a gym and a pool, I could go a bit higher.",6,4
247,0,"Well, we have 2 pools, a beautifully lit tennis court, and fitness center and free wi-fi in the common area.  The apartment has a/c, central heat, private patios or balconies with views of the East Bay hills.  Location is ideal - close to local shopping and dining and easy commute to local business centers and the BART station.  I can accept $2000",2,0
248,0,You have me convinced.  I will go $2000.,0,3
249,0,Great.  Can you stop over this evening and sign a lease?,0,0
250,0,"Hello, I'm am interested in your apartment.",0,0
251,0,It's a great place!,0,0
252,0,It looks nice. I am on a budget can we negotiate.,0,4
253,0,"sure, what did you have in mind?",0,0
254,0,I would like to spend about $1037.00 for your apartment.,4,4
255,0,"Sorry, that is way lower than my asking price. We need to come a bit on that.",4,4
256,0,Does your price include water and trash?,5,6
257,0,"Yea, it does. And central air and heating.",0,0
258,0,"Oh great, does $1800.00 work for you?",4,4
259,0,I can do $1950 and offer my patio furniture to go with the apartment?,6,6
260,0,"Thats great, thank you.",0,0
261,0,Hi! You were interested in the Ranger?,0,0
262,0,"It looks nice, but I really don't think it's worth what you're asking.",1,0
263,0,"How come? It was very well maintained through our company, everything runs perfect on it. Just like new.",0,0
264,0,It's 6 years old and that mileage seems high. If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time,1,2
265,0,"The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever.",0,2
266,0,"I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000",2,4
267,0,"4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you.",6,6
268,0,"I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty",6,4
269,0,"I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back!",6,6
270,0,"Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer.",3,3
271,0,"If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount. I'll pend you an offer. Think about it. Thank you for your time either way!",4,6
272,0,Ive got $80 I can spend on the phone.,4,0
273,0,"The phone is listed at 160, I'm not taking 80 for it.",2,3

325,0,"Well, that's considerably more than budget will allow. I have seen some of them elsewhere at around $80. Would you take 90 for them?",2,7

360,0,I could do a longer contract if you would consider coming down on the rent a little. Say to $3000?,6,4
361,0,So we could meet in the middle. I can do a two year contract for $3100 a month.,4,3
362,0,"Okay, that sounds like a fair deal. Thank you!",0,0

395,0,how about 900 if I pick it up and pay cash.,6,6
396,0,"Eh, $900 is too low for me. The bike has very expensive custom rotors on both wheels. Those alone are worth $500. I can go down to $1100 but that's my lowest.",2,2
397,0,"How about 10,500? That and its a deal.",4,4
398,0,"Make it $10,700 and we have a deal.",3,3

409,0,"Hmmm, I don't have any gold coins....",0,0

429,0,"What can I say, It's a high-end neighborhood.",0,7
430,0,"Kool man, but do you got any wiggle room at all?",0,0
431,0,What were you thinking?,0,0
432,0,how about a grand cash,0,0
433,0,"Well, that's way too low for this area. I hope you can afford over 2500.",4,4
434,0,"WOW, I see you point on where it is and all, but how many offers got cash on hand and will meet you today with that cash, how about 1200 cash",6,6
435,0,We usually only take personal checks. If you have great credit we might rent it for 2400.,4,4
436,0,I am in the cash only type of buiz.  how about 1600 cash?,4,6
437,0,It sounds like you need to look in a different type of area for housing.,4,0
438,0,"nah man, 1600?  To low?  Tell you what thrown the TV in the pic and I will do 1900?",6,6
439,0,I'm sorry but it doesn't seem like we will be able to rent to you. Have a nice day.,0,0

446,0,I only have 3800 cash right now. Would you come down on the price a bit?,7,4
447,0,I was really hoping to get 4000 at the lowest. Is there anyway you could get that in the next few days?,4,0
448,0,I could get that in a week if you'd be willing to wait to sell it till then.,4,6
449,0,I can definitely hold it for you for a small down payment.,6,0
450,0,Okay I'll give you the down payment and then give you the rest next week then!,0,0
451,0,That is great! Thank you.,0,0
452,0,Hello.,0,0
453,0,"Hello. I saw your listing and I am interested in your car. However, I have a few questions.",0,0
454,0,"Sure, go ahead.",0,0
455,0,Has it been in any major accidents?,1,1

458,0,"Yes, everything has been checked out recently.",0,0
459,0,"Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.",4,4
460,0,I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.,6,6
461,0,"13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500",7,3

467,0,"I only have the blue one, but it is in like new condition.",5,0
468,0,"Okay, I can still use that, but now the price is an issue for me. What can we do about that?",4,1
469,0,"well, I will throw in free delivery and a 3 month warranty for the $100.",6,6
470,0,I can't afford $100 because I am not working full time. I just have a certain budget. I can only pay $76 for it,7,7
471,0,"That is a really big difference!  I will also throw in a helmet and bring the price down to $95.  So, you will get the bike, the helmet, delivery, and a 3 month warranty.  I feel that this is more than fair.  Wouldn't you agree?",6,0
472,0,I would appreciate if you waive the other options as I just want the bike for my kid. Can we work $80 for it?,4,6
473,0,Can we split the difference and agree on 87.50?,4,4
474,0,okay I think I can do that by taking in more hours at work at least my kid will be happy :),0,0
475,0,"Agreed, thank you!",0,0
476,0,This looks nice but the price seems a bit high.,4,4
477,0,Yes definitely but its pricey because of its quality.,2,2
478,0,Are the tires full or flat?,5,5
479,0,they're full and in great condition,0,0

481,0,"well, how about $190?",4,4
482,0,If you have a helmet I'd be able to do 190,6,6
483,0,I can definitely provide you a helmet. What color preferences do you have?,0,5
484,0,I'd love a blue or green one.,0,0
485,0,Sure thing then you will get either of the two colors. So do we meet up tomorrow to finish the deal?,0,0

489,0,Tell me more about the subs.,0,0
490,0,"Well what exactly would you like to know about? I've had this for about a year, and it is still in really nice condition.",0,0
491,0,Are there in other perks to it other than what you have listed?,5,1
492,0,I have a 1000 watt rms amp that I'm looking to get rid of for just 135 extra.,0,4
493,0,"Ok, I'm not looking for an amp at the moment.",0,0
494,0,That's fine you can get the subs for the original price still!,0,0
495,0,I've looked at various websites for the same sub and I've seen much lower prices.,4,0
496,0,There is a little wiggle room I could provide depending on how much you'd like to spend,4,4
497,0,"I would like to do $99 because I found one for $75 online, but it is too far away. I prefer to have the subs sooner rather than later, but I don't mind waiting if I only have to spend $75. I can offer $99 and pick it up myself so you don't have to worry about a shipping price or the gas to bring it to my place.",6,6
498,0,I'd really like $110 for this. Just a bit more than what you're offering.,4,4
499,0,I can manage that.,0,0
500,0,Great so 110 is a deal?,0,0
501,0,It's a deal.,0,0
502,0,"Hello, I'm very interested in the vehicle you have for sale",0,0

511,0,OK I will accept that,0,0
512,0,Good deal! Thank you,0,0
513,0,"Hello, I'd like to rent this apartment but I don't think the price is worth it especially since I cannot have my dog",1,7
514,0,"While I cannot change the pets policy, I am willing to negotiate the price.",0,4
515,0,Is it possible to go as low as 1000/mo?,4,4

517,0,"That's quite a bit over the list price, does this include any utilities?",4,6
518,0,"It has shared and coined laundry machines. Air conditioning. Redone kitchen counter tops in 2014. Utilities, such as gas, internet, electric, must be covered by you.",0,0
519,0,What's the justification for renting at above the list price then? I currently rent a similar apartment down the street for $1250/mo and that includes a washer/dryer in the unit.,1,6
520,0,"The location of the apartment is a factor. Also, the landlord pays for water, garbage, sewage, and HOA fees. So I feel you still are getting a good deal. But I can go down to 1600/mo.",2,2
521,0,"I have a great deal of experience with landscaping, is it possible to negotiate a deal where I maintain the property for a deduction in the monthly rent? I can assure you my work is excellent and I can refer you to previous clients",6,2
522,0,"I am sorry, but I cannot accept that offer. 1600/mo is my final offer.",3,3

626,0,Hi!,0,0
627,0,Hi there. Are you interested in this house?,0,0
628,0,Yes Very!,0,0
629,0,Sure do you have any questions or concerns?,0,0
630,0,I wanted to know what makes this house special compared to the other ones on this street. There is an open house down the road that I looked at that was very similar to this house.,5,1
631,0,"This house is 3 bedroom and is in Fremont. It has a 2 car garage which is awesome I think and kitchen contains granite counters, and cabinets are modern. There is a yard also, and its location is the best that beats everything. It is near to schools, parks, restaurants, and shopping. I can very positively tell you that you can't go wrong with this purchase!",0,0
632,0,Ok cool! What is the lowest you will go in price?,4,4
633,0,The listing is 2650. I can give it to you for $2200,4,4
634,0,$2150 and you have a deal!,4,4
635,0,$2200 is the last I can give you. I have a waiting list for people who are already willing to get it! That's what I can give you. Take it or leave it.,3,3
636,0,You are one tough cookie!,0,0
637,0,Well we both need to be happy :),0,0
638,0,Sounds good I'll take it!,0,0
639,0,Hello!,0,0
640,0,Are you interested in 6 Commodore Drive Unit C430?,0,0
641,0,"I am, but I was wondering if there was any chance of the price being negotiable.",4,0
642,0,"Hello, are you there?",0,0
643,0,I have a little wiggle room.,4,0
644,0,Computer froze up for a moment.,0,0
645,0,"I just live everything about it, but I am looking to pay below $2000.",4,4
646,0,"Hm.  Well, remember that this is a 1 bedroom 1 bath in a fantastic area.",4,2
647,0,I understand that. This is the one place where I have been lookin for an apartment to become available.,0,0
648,0,It's also been renovated.  It has a great parking space that comes with the apartment.,0,0
649,0,Would you take $2000? It is only a little less than what you are asking.,4,4
650,0,"What about $2100?  I think that's fair.  This does include a lot of luxuries, including community laundry rooms, heated pools, hot tubs, saunas, and a fitness center.",2,2
651,0,What do you think?,0,0
652,0,"Oh, I wasn't made aware of those amenities!!! If I fixed things up that need repairs would you take the $2000?",6,2
653,0,"That's still a little low.  Actually, the place has granite counter tops and gorgeous flooring in there already.  I'm still looking for $2100.",2,2
654,0,It is definitely over my original budget of under $1500 that I was looking for. I may need to keep looking even though this place is great.,7,2
655,0,I tell you what...let me see if we can do $2050.  What do you think?,4,4
656,0,I think I could do the extra $50. That seems fair.,0,4
657,0,Deal!,0,0
658,0,Thank you for being considerate.,0,0
659,0,Does it come furnished?,5,5
660,0,We can make sure it's furnished for you if you prefer.,0,0
661,0,How many bedrooms and bathrooms?,5,5
662,0,It is a 2 bedroom 1 1/2 bath,0,0
663,0,is the 2nd bedroom big enough for 2 twin beds and maybe some room for the kids to play?,5,5
664,0,yes the 2nd bedroom is about 10x12,0,0
665,0,How far away from the school is it?,5,5
666,0,"It is walking distance from the school, a couple of blocks.",0,0
667,0,Would you be willing to go $2450?,4,4
668,0,I can go $2700 with furniture or $2500 without furniture.,6,6
669,0,I can do the 2500 if it comes with appliances in the kitchen at least.,6,6
670,0,I can make sure there is a refrigerator and stove for $2500.  The refrigerator and stove will be purchased and already installed before you move in.,6,0
671,0,Sounds great.,0,0
672,0,"Hello, is this house still for sale?",5,0
673,0,"Yes, it is still available for leasing. Would you like to come take a tour?",0,0
674,0,I would love to.  Can you tell me a little about it?,5,5
675,0,It is a 3 Bedroom 1 bath home. In great neighborhood. It's professionally maintained. It is a must see house.,0,0
676,0,What are you asking for the house?,5,5
677,0,Rent is $1595 a month. Utilities are not included.,0,0
678,0,Are you able to go any lower?  The comps around the neighboorhood are cheaper than this price.,4,4
679,0,"We can offer you a discount of $100/mo if you can sign 1 year lease, providing that your application is approved.",6,6
680,0,Would you be willing to accept 1395 if I signed a 2 year lease?,6,6
681,0,"Sorry, right now we can only offer the $100 discount. Remember we do the maintenance, including landscapes. That alone adds value to your lease.",6,0
682,0,"Ok, well I think 1395 is a fair deal if you will be able to pay for half the utilities.  That is my last offer, take it or leave it.",6,6
683,0,"Hello, you are interested in the ad for the sofa set?",0,0
684,0,Yes I really like it can you tell me more about the set?,5,5
685,0,"Sure, this is a 2 piece set. We've got the sofa and the chair as pictured. You saw the dimensions in the ad I assume? The sofa is 94 inches across and the chair is 38 inches. I would be willing to take $1250 for the pair.",0,0
686,0,I really like it but could offer you $600 and I will come and pick it up myself and provide my own truck,6,6
687,0,"Understood, but that's pretty far below what we paid for it and I know the sofa alone is worth more than $600.",4,4
688,0,Ok I understand that is a low offer but the condition does not look that great. how about $750,4,4
689,0,The condition is actually very good. The set has been in a smoke free home and has seen very little wear from use.  I could go to $1100.,2,2
690,0,that is still quite high can we agree on $1000,4,3
691,0,"I could do $1,000. Do you have someone who can help you with the pick up?",0,6
692,0,yes I have a friend who will help me and he has a pick up truck $1000 it is then,0,0
693,0,Hello.,0,0
694,0,hello,0,0
695,0,"Yes, I'm interested in the binoculars from your ad?",0,0
696,0,"Oh, sure!  They are still available",0,0
697,0,Are there any problems with the binoculars?,1,1
698,0,"No, none that I know of.  I just do not use them as much as I thought I would.",0,0
699,0,"Well, then I suppose I'd be willing to take them off your hands. I'd like to pay$216 for the binoculars.",4,4
700,0,"My asking price $380.  I could go slightly lower but I can not sell them for $216, sorry.",4,4
701,0,"Well, what would your best price be?",0,0
702,0,$340 would be fine with me,4,0
703,0,"Well, I'd be willing to drive over and pick them up, if you can come down to $260.",6,6
704,0,"$300 would be my best offer, I do not think I can go lower, sorry.",3,3
705,0,"Well, I suppose that's fair. I'll accept that price.",0,0
706,0,Great!,0,0
707,0,any questions about the item?,0,0
708,0,Can you tell me about the apartment? 2450 seems quite a bit above the going rate in that neighboorhood. I was looking for closer to 1225,4,4
709,0,this is completely remodeled.  It is like new,0,0
710,0,"the pictures look great, but it still seems a bit pricey compared to other apartments in the area. I can do 1600, just because I like that building",4,2
711,0,i can go 2200 a month,4,4
712,0,"ummm. I don't know, it doesn't even have a washer/dryer. I would have to share with the neighbor. I could go up to 1900 if you put in a washer/dryer",2,2
713,0,2100 and the washer and dryer are yours,6,6
714,0,That is still way too high for the area. I'm pretty firm on the 1900. I have a great history as a renter with lots of referneces. I won't trash your place and pay my rent on time.,3,2
715,0,"ok, 2000",4,0
716,0,How about 1950 and the washer and dryer. I think we could both be happy with that.,6,6
717,0,hi,0,0
718,0,"Hi, I like your bike. It reminds me of one I used to own back in the day. I would jump it off ramps while rocking a TMNT t-shirt.",0,0
719,0,its a nice bike normal wear and tear,0,0
720,0,Is the chain rusty? It looks as though it hasn't been greased in a while.,1,0
721,0,no rust but it needs a brake,0,2
722,0,"The asking price is fair, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to pay $150 for it. If you do the $150, I'll perform some awesome wheelies for you before I leave.",4,4
723,0,"it is 27 years old you can not find these anymore, how about $170",4,4
724,0,"You're right, those bikes are hard to come by. How about we meet in the middle and do $160?",4,4
725,0,$165 is as low as i can go,3,3
726,0,"If it had the original wheels, I would do the $165. But I need to stay firm at $160. It's a good compromise I feel.",2,3
727,0,"You are right about the wheels, ok $160",0,0
728,0,Deal!,0,0
729,0,Ok,0,0
730,0,Hello,0,0
731,0,Hello are you still selling the Settee?,0,0
732,0,"Yes, I am. I am asking 200 dollars for it, but I am willing to listen to offers and make a deal.",0,0
733,0,Sounds good. What does the wear and tear look like on it though? What kind of condition is it in?,1,1
734,0,"It is in good condition. There are no holes, or scratches.",0,0
735,0,How long have you had it for?,1,5
736,0,Only a year and have barely sat on it. It is like new.,0,0
737,0,Oh okay that's good. Could you come down on the price at all? I've seen some used ones going for a lot less.,4,4
738,0,Sure. How much would you like to pay for it?,0,0
739,0,Could you do it for 80?,4,4
740,0,How about 100 and I will deliver it to you myself?,6,6
741,0,Okay we have a deal!,0,0
742,0,Good,0,0
743,0,"Hi, can you tell me a little more about this house?",5,5
744,0,Hello,0,0
745,0,It is a beautiful house,0,5
746,0,What are some of the perks?,5,5
747,0,"Great green lawn, garage",0,0
748,0,Does it have a swimming pool?  My family and I are new to the area and would like to lease for at least 6 mos. maybe more but the kids really would like a pool.  How much wiggle room in the price?,4,4
749,0,"$3,100.00",4,4
750,0,That's a little steep.  Would you accept 2975?,4,4
751,0,3000,4,4
752,0,Are utilities included?,5,5
753,0,Yes,0,0
754,0,"ok, I'll take it for 3000",0,0
755,0,Is this for sale or rent?,0,5
756,0,It is for rent.,0,0
757,0,how many bedrooms are available,5,5
758,0,This unit is a 3 bedroom.,0,0
759,0,Are any utilities included?,5,5
760,0,Utilities are not included in the rent price.,0,0
761,0,"I would need a lower rent price so that I can pay for utlities, $1000",4,7
762,0,1000 is far too low. We can bring the price down to 2300 if you have good employment.,4,4
763,0,"you barely moved on price, how about $1200",4,4
764,0,"You started from too low of a price, this is a platinum upgraded apartment with premium features. You can't just ask any low ball price and expect a deal.",2,2
765,0,"Platinum is in quotes in the listing, I'm not so sure of the legitimacy of this apartment",1,2
766,0,It is easily verified online and also in person at the office. Are you actually interested in the apartment?,2,0
767,0,"I would have to see it in person, does the complex have a pool or gym?",5,5
768,0,Yes we have a great pool and also a full gym on site.,0,0
769,0,"That sounds good, I can do $1500",4,0
770,0,2200 and we cannot lower the price any further.,3,3
771,0,ok,0,0
772,0,"Hey there, I am Brian, I left an email about the apartment for rent.",0,0
773,0,Hello Brian thanks for writing. Do you have any questions about the apartment?,0,0
774,0,"I do, it's about the price. I like the location of this apartment very much, but the price is ridiculous. The post says there is a $500 off special. I'm curious, is that deducted from the price you listed the apartment at?",5,7
775,0,It would be on the price we both agree upon.,0,0
776,0,"So then with the $500 off, how does $700 sound all together?",4,4
777,0,There is no way that would be possible.,3,0
778,0,Then can we work out a deal close to that? I can assure you that I can pay rent on time.,4,6
779,0,The lowest I'm authorized to go is 900. And that would be the flat monthly rent. The first month's rent would be 400 with the deduction.,3,3
780,0,"If I give you 900, could we settle free parking for my first month as well?",6,6
781,0,Yes that can be done. So overall you'll be saving quite a lot. So 900 is good for you?,0,0
782,0,"Hello, are you interested in the unit?",0,0
783,0,Yes. How many rooms and baths?,5,5
784,0,"This is a two-bedroom, one bath.",0,0
785,0,Please tell me about the neighborhood and neighbors?,5,5
786,0,"The neighborhood is great. Most people are young professionals who keep business hours, and you'll find the community to be quiet and private. Lots of nearby shops.",0,0
787,0,Sounds good.  Is the $500 off move in special just for the first month or more?,5,5
788,0,The $500 move in special is just for the first month.,0,0
789,0,I'd be willing to pay 1375 if parking is included,6,6
790,0,"I'll go down to $1425 and include parking, as well as water.",6,6
791,0,sounds good! Thank you!,0,0
792,0,Thanks!,0,0
793,0,hello,0,0
794,0,Hello. Are you interested in our services?,0,0
795,0,Yes I am,0,0
796,0,Ok. We charge $50 for unlocking and flashing phone devices.,0,0
797,0,That much. Are you willing to discount the price for first time customers,6,4
798,0,For first time customers we offer a price of $45 for the service.,6,4
799,0,That's still pretty steep..Hmm what about 35.00?,4,4
800,0,"Sorry, I can not go that low. The best I could do is $45 and have the device back to you within 30 minutes.",6,6
801,0,What other services do I get with 45.00?,5,4
802,0,There are no other services? We unlock and flash phones to remove them from the network--that's what we do.,0,0
803,0,If you are flashing my phone I still have to pay for first month service. You are not losing anything with 35.00. I still have to pay for first month service.,1,6
804,0,"I can make you a final offer of $45 to which you can accept or reject. Sorry, our prices are firm.",3,3
805,0,Do I get a free phone case with it? What about 40.00?,4,6
806,0,I do not see us reaching an agreement here.,3,0
807,0,"Hi, is the Honda CRV EX still for sale?",0,0
808,0,Hey,0,0
809,0,Is the car still for sale?,0,5
810,0,"Yes, it's still for sale.",0,0
811,0,I'm looking for a car for my daughter.  Can you tell me more about the car?,5,5
812,0,"The car gets 27 MPG AVG in the city alone, so I'm not sure where your daughter will need to commute, but it won't cost her much. Also, the car is in great running condition.",0,0
813,0,She just needs to get back and forth to work but she has to drive freeway miles.  How many miles are on the car?,5,5
814,0,"I apologize, but for some reason I do not have that information on hand. Can I get back to you ASAP with the exact mileage?",0,0
815,0,Sure.  I just wanted to know if there are a lot of miles on it.  So what's the least you'll take for it?,0,2
816,0,"There isn't a whole lot of mileage on it, but I'll let you know for sure. The best I can do is $21,000.",4,2
817,0,"wozer...! I was looking at maybe $11,000",4,4
818,0,"I'm sorry but I couldn't let the car go for that amount. I know you need the car for your daughter to get back and forth, so I'll definitely work with you. Would you be willing to pay $16,000 for the car?",4,4
819,0,"That is still a reach for me.  How about $15,500?",4,4
820,0,"$15,750 and we have a deal.",4,3
821,0,Deal!  I can do that.,0,0
822,0,Sold!,0,0
823,0,Great.  Please accept my offer on the right.,0,0
824,0,hi,0,0
825,0,Hello.  I'd like to buy the bike for 104.,0,0
826,0,"That is a little low for me, I am willing to come down slightly.",4,4
827,0,The most I will pay is 115.,3,7
828,0,well would you be willing to pick it up?,6,6
829,0,yes I will pick it up,0,0
830,0,I cannot include the helmet or pump at that price.. or you can have them if you can come up to 145,6,6
831,0,I don't want the helmet or the pump.  Just the bike.   115 okay?,6,7
832,0,120 if you can come get it and you have a deal.,6,3
833,0,I think 115 is a fair price as the one tire has cracks.   115 and I will pick up.,6,6
834,0,"Sorry that is just too low for me, it was already a price cut at the listed 149.",4,3
835,0,Hello,0,0

980,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,4,5
981,0,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",6,6
982,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",0,0

1004,0,Can I sublet a bedroom and rent my space?,5,0

1019,0,"Good, thanks. So you are interested in flashing your phone?",0,0
1020,0,"I am. The only way I will be able to use this phone is to have it flashed, however, all I have is $50 and I have to buy diapers also this evening. The diapers are 22.97 and all I have is the remainder. Is there a way you could work with me somehow?",7,0
1021,0,I could come down a little. Can you do $40?,4,4
1022,0,I believe the service is valued at more than I have but if I do $40 I would not be able to afford my sons diapers as well. I believe your service is worth more and if I had it to offer I most definitely would,7,7
1023,0,I am sorry to hear about your predicament. Could you buy a smaller pack of diapers and pay $30?,4,7
1024,0,"He is a big boy and the only ones they have are the small pack and it is 22.97, if you can work with me with the last $3 I would be forever grateful and make sure to tell my friends what a wonderful service you provide",6,6

1033,0,"I'm sorry, but that's just too low an offer. These apartments are already a steal at $1556 a month. I have a little room to negotiate, but I couldn't come down to 800.",4,4
1034,0,"Oh okay, I am willing to do at least 1000",4,4
1035,0,"If you can come up to $1400, I could have a crew come in and remove the shag carpeting; it's hardwood underneath in the bathroom.",6,6

1107,0,I believe the service is valued at more than I have but if I do $40 I would not be able to afford my sons diapers as well. I believe your service is worth more and if I had it to offer I most definitely would,0,7

1224,0,No only 3 years,0,0
1225,0,Wow that's a long time. May I ask why didn't you use it? Does it work well or are there any malfunctions associated?,1,1
1226,0,Well I love the bike but I had been riding cross country on an endurance bike. So this has been fairly unused. No malfunctions I had made sure to periodically spray it with anti rust and anti seeze. Also it was left in a dry and secure environment.,0,0
1227,0,"Okay that's good ti know. However, the price is very high for me. Is there anyway that we can work on that?",7,7
1228,0,Yes but Id prefer to not go too low as I said before I love the bike and I am reluctuant to sell. Mainly selling due to me down sizing and lack of use.,0,2
1229,0,I can offer $390 as its old and has been sitting. Would appreciate it if you consider it,2,2
1230,0,390 is a bit harsh on me. Tell you what I can add a free delivery and a standard set of maintenace equipment specific to this type of bike,6,6

1232,0,lets start at 550 and negotiate in increments of 10 from there?,3,0

1239,0,"Well,it is unbelievably comfortable.It just clashed with my other furniture.I can maybe go down a little?",0,2
1240,0,"I was hoping to pay maybe half if possible, ideally. That seems like a good price for a used couch.",2,4
1241,0,I wouldn't call it used.I think it was sat on twice so the price listed is practically a steal!How about $950?,2,2
1242,0,"Hmm. I could go $600, how about that? By the way is the couch easy to disassemble, or does it have to be moved intact? I'm thinking about how easily it could be transported.",4,6
1243,0,"Hello, Do you have any interest in my couch for sale?",0,0
1244,0,"Yes, I think it is a quite attractive couch, although that is a lot of money for me right now. I was hoping to pay maybe half of what you're asking--what do you think?",2,0
1245,0,You are right about it being attractive! Give me a price and I will see what I can do.,0,0
1246,0,"Well, how about $500? I know it's much less than you are asking for, but I'd be giving it a great home!",6,4
1247,0,"I'd love for it to have a great home, but I need to have a home too! LoL! How about $850?",4,4
1248,0,"Oh, we're definitely moving in the right direction! That's still a bit steep for me but...well...I really like that it is made from largely recycled materials. How about $600? By the way can this couch be easily dissasembled for transport? If not I'm probably going to have to rent a small moving truck.",7,2
1249,0,"Tell you what. I will deliver it to you assembled at no extra charge.Plus, I'll even throw in two free throw pillows all for $825.Oh yes, it is made from recycled materials.That is a wonderful thing!",6,6
1250,0,Thanks for offering to deliver it assembled if we can come to an agreement--that will make it much easier on my end. It's still a bit pricey for me. How about $725?,4,4
1251,0,"If you factor in the price of a moving truck with my offer it is a steal!You'd be paying less with my deal,but since I feel you truly love this couch I will drop it down to $800 and still provide my additional services!",0,3
1252,0,"Well...that is more than I can comfortably pay but it is a very attractive couch and since you're offering to set it up, I will accept your offer of $800.",0,3
1253,0,Great! You won't be sorry. Let's get this transaction started! Thank you!,0,0
1254,0,hi,0,0

1294,0,"Yes, there is nothing wrong with it at all. I have all manual for it also. I also can put the mat that I bought to go under it with it. I'd like to get $150",6,0
1295,0,"Oh, I must have read the ad wrong I thought you were asking $125?  So is your price negotiable at all?",4,7

1297,0,"Oh ok, would you come down to $75? I have cash and could come get it tonight.",6,6
1298,0,I can't go that low. I would come down to $135 if you pick it up tonight but no Mat.,6,6
