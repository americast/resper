216,0,"105 is still too low, i say we go with 125 split the difference",3,3

223,0,"Great, how much can you reasonably come down to?",0,3
224,0,Well the item is listed for $350 how much are you looking to spend,3,0
225,0,"Well a new bedroom set like this I could probably buy from the store for $500, so I'd have to say since it's used it needs to be in the 150 price range.",4,4
226,0,"Last time I was in the store, a whole bedroom set which included the bed, dresser and two night stands was on sale for $1500 brand new.  I can go as low as 275.00",4,4

231,0,Does it offer bluetooth?,1,0
232,0,It doesn't i'm sorry,0,0
233,0,Well that will effect my final price...is it a 2-way speaker?,1,0
234,0,I'm not sure what you mean by 2-way,0,0
235,0,It just is something about the sound resonation I think I really do not know the specifics I just know you shpuld make sure any speakers you buy are two way.,1,0
236,0,Sine I don't know that I will be able to lower the price for you if that helps.,0,3
237,0,Yes it would...can you tell me what btu it pushes?,1,0

299,0,"Thats great, but I do not need any more. How about 500 for whats listed?",3,3
300,0,I think at this point if I would go any lower it would most likely be 800.00 which is a steal in all honesty.,3,4
301,0,That is still a lot. I think we cannot agree. It's been a pleasure though.,6,0

324,0,"I'll arrange to have it refinished, and pay for that out of pocket, if you agree to $600 purchase price",5,5

586,0,No pets and no smoking,0,0
587,0,"Is there a reason for ""no pets""? (Mine are up-to-date on vaccines and obedience trained).",0,0
588,0,"Hello, are you interested in this vehicle?",0,0
589,0,Yes I am.  Does the vehicle have a sun roof?,1,1
590,0,"No sun roof, they were notorious for leaking so when I picked up the vehicle I chose a model without the sun roof.",0,0
591,0,Okay.  I was really hoping for a sun roof.   Could you do $3400?,3,3
592,0,"Well, that's a little less than I was hoping for. Could you come up to $3750?",3,3
593,0,I can come up to 3450,3,3
594,0,"Everything in this car runs great, and I'm willing to have it cleaned and detailed. I'll even throw in a little pine tree air fresher, and whatever cd is still in the cd player. All that, for only $3650?",5,5

604,0,"Before we talk price, why wouldn't I want this, Whats wrong with it?",2,2
605,0,I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this table. It has the expected wear and tear of it being perfectly vintage but other than that it's a beautiful table with smooth working drawers and a very sturdy base.,0,0
606,0,Why haven't you bothered restoring it?,2,2
607,0,"To keep it as vintage as possible, and for the buyer to restore it as they want, should they see fit.",0,0
608,0,"Well I really can't justify paying $135 for an old side table, I have a budget of $55, so I can do that if you deliver it.",5,5

619,0,"What's the story behind the salvaged title? That seems like a pretty serious red flag. You're asking $4,700 for a pretty old car with a lot of miles on it.",2,0
620,0,It was just a little bump I got fixed up after the accident. I claimed it as a salvaged car for insurance purposes.,0,0
621,0,"I see. Well, considering the age and condition. Multiple owners, the salvaged title and all that... I could give you $3,000 for it.",3,4
622,0,"I don't know about that. It's a strong car, very dependable it's Japanese. The part's total to $4000 alone.",4,4

868,0,I can give it to you for $250,3,3
869,0,Hmmm my budget for a mattress is not really that high to begin with and it is a used mattress. I was hoping to pay about $135,3,4

872,0,Well there is no such issue. I can give you the cover as well with it if you're interested.,5,0
873,0,Well if the mattress is already used I would definitely at least have to buy a new cover. If the mattress is contaminated then the cover that was being used on it would be too. If I come and pick it up right away and pay in cash could you do $150?,5,5

1295,0,"I think the smooth ride and handling, also the color is great , pearl white.",0,0
1296,0,Okay. That's good to hear. What do you think about $5000 even for it. Of course you know that you priced it a bit high.,3,3
1297,0,I researched and that is more than fair market value. I am willing to lower it but feel 5000 is too low.,4,3
1298,0,"Well, it's a used car without a warranty. I can go a little bit higher than 5k, but I need a warranty.",5,4
1299,0,"you are mistaken, there is a warranty.",4,0
1300,0,What's the warranty? I don't see it in your advertisement,3,1

1309,0,"Well, $800 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $650 if I were to come and pick it up?  Might save you a little bit of hassle....",5,5
1310,0,That s a lot lower than I hoped it would be. I want to sell it for $775 because of how close it is to that of a brand new bike in terms of quality.,4,4
1311,0,Hmmm....How about $725?,3,3
1312,0,"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?",3,3

1428,0,Sorry but like I said I'm soldi at $6500.,6,0

1472,0,have you used it a lot?,2,1
1473,0,"For te first month or so, yes, but then grew six to seven inches and the frame was too small. Bought it on Craigslist six months ago. Just trying to recoup some of what I paid for it.",0,0
1474,0,okay. I would like to get it but the price is way way high for me. Is there anything we can do about it?,7,3

1507,0,Sounds nice. can you go down a bit? How about $2500?,3,3
1508,0,"That is a little too far down to me. I am asking 5300 for it and that is over 50% off from my asking price. I can give you a little more info about the car so you can see how valuable it actually is... It has 4WD/AWD, automatic trans, BOSE sound system and more..",4,4
1509,0,Yes. The money a little tight here. How about 3800 all cash?,5,3

1520,0,You seem like an honest person. I'd be willing to meet you somewhere up in the middle. What do you say we make it 1100 and I'll cover electricity for the first two months?,5,5
1521,0,"Can you do $975? I really want this studio, and that's about as much as I can afford.",7,3
1522,0,I'll do 975 and cover electricity for 1 month at that price.,0,5
1523,0,That sounds perfect. I will send you an official offer of $975.,0,0

1533,0,"Alright, I would like to come check it out and get a test drive. If I am able to pay cash would you consider $25000?",5,5
1534,0,"Best I will accept (cash offer)   would be an even $27,000  because a non mod  clean ass Roush Mustang is a rare find today and mine is in amazing condition and has been WELL up-kept and maintained",4,0
1535,0,Do you have a cover for it?,1,1
1536,0,"Yes I can include the ""like new""  cover for the Mustang and throw in some Armorall for the Wheels and the Interior, and the matching Seat Covers and Wheel cover  for and even  $27,100?    :)",5,5

1544,0,Great. the price is too high for me. Are you willing to negotiate it?,7,3
1545,0,Yeah if you could sign a longer lease I can come down a bit. This is type of price you'll see in this area but I'll give a little leeway.,5,0
1546,0,$897?,3,3

1548,0,How about 1000?,3,3
1549,0,if you can bump it up to 1200 we've got a deal,6,0

1564,0,"Yeah, but it looks like it might need some work that I would have to pay for, so I was hoping I could get it for $850",4,3
1565,0,I can't do that. It's been updated recently and has stainless steel appliances. It's a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. 1895 is a steal,4,0
1566,0,"I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out?",6,3
1567,0,That's crazy. A studio half the size went for 1800. How about 1650? Recently remodeled!,4,3
1568,0,It's not the size that I'm basing this on... it's the location and exterior. How about $1000?,4,4
1569,0,Did I mention it comes with an offshores bank account with 500k? $1750. ;),4,0
1570,0,"Wow, that sound shady. How about this... $1050 and I don't report you to the feds? ;)",5,5

1604,0,You are quite far from me but I would really like this.  Is there anyway you could take $5 for it?,3,3

1624,0,I'm fine.  I'm interested but my budget is limited.  I can offer you $1200 for the apartment.,7,7
1625,0,I think that will be too low. It has all the amenities like gym and parking spot. You can save a lot of money. And there is a storage space too. Beautiful and nicely done,4,4
1626,0,It sounds nice but some of the amenities aren't of any use to me and my preference isn't to be on the third floor.  I have a little wiggle room but not a huge amount.,4,0
1627,0,"Ok, how about if I'll pay the bills for you?",5,5
1628,0,"Well, give me numbers.  What type of numbers are we talking about?",2,0

1637,0,Nice truck! Can we negotiate on the price?,3,0
1638,0,Hello,0,0
1639,0,"Hi! Can you come down on the price a little? The mileage isn't listed and this could be a concern later down the road. Can we start negotiations at $23,000?",4,0
1640,0,Dude... you are trying to lowball me before you even ask me anything about the truck... that is kind of disrespectful...,2,0
1641,0,I'm sorry if you see it that way. Can you please tell me more about it? I'm definitely not trying to low ball you at all!,1,3

1645,0,"It's not listed on the ad. Would you take $24,300? I'll come pick it up today.",4,5
1646,0,Sorry it wasn't included in the ad but that isn't really a reason for me to lower the price. This seems to be a waste of my time.,2,0
1647,0,Hi I saw your bike online and i'm very interested,0,0
1648,0,Hello,0,0
1649,0,"Great, do you have any questions?",0,0
1650,0,Yes what shape are the tires in?  Also how is the paint on the body,1,1
1651,0,"It is in great condition, nice and clean. The paint and tires are perfect. It is only 6months old",0,0
1652,0,"Ok sounds good, just what I was looking for.  I can bring you $700 cash right now.",1,3
1653,0,"Well as the ad says, the price is pretty firm at $1350 ...",6,3
1654,0,Yeah I saw that but it is a used bike and I don't know who had it before you and how good they took care of it.  Also you could have the cash in your hand today and I would be glad to come pick it up and load it myself,4,5
1655,0,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price.",4,0
1656,0,"Well people may be hesitant to buy with you selling it so soon, they might wonder why you want to get rid of it?  I can do $1000 cash and I'll pick up!",5,5

1664,0,Yes I am very interested,0,0
1665,0,Okay great well I am asking $3400,0,0
1666,0,That is a little over my budget.  I have excellent credit and can put down a deposit in cash.  Would you be willing to consider $2000?,7,7
1667,0,I'm sorry but for this unit and in the area that price is too low. I can work with you and let this work for $3000 which is still very low!,4,4
1668,0,What if I pay an extra $500 on the deposit?  Could you do $2700?,5,3
1669,0,This is still very low for this town house. $2900 is the lowest I can go,6,6
1670,0,Ok well I can take the $2900 but without the extra deposit money,5,5

1711,0,Interested in this property?,0,0
1712,0,"Yeah, but it looks like it might need some work that I would have to pay for, so I was hoping I could get it for $850",0,3
1713,0,I can't do that. It's been updated recently and has stainless steel appliances. It's a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. 1895 is a steal,0,0
1714,0,"I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out?",0,3
1715,0,That's crazy. A studio half the size went for 1800. How about 1650? Recently remodeled!,0,3
1716,0,It's not the size that I'm basing this on... it's the location and exterior. How about $1000?,0,4
1717,0,Did I mention it comes with an offshores bank account with 500k? $1750. ;),0,0
1718,0,"Wow, that sound shady. How about this... $1050 and I don't report you to the feds? ;)",0,5

1771,0,Good! How are you? Are you interested in my apartment?,0,0
1772,0,I'm fine. I'm interested but my budget is limited. I can offer you $1200 for the apartment.,0,7
1773,0,I think that will be too low. It has all the amenities like gym and parking spot. You can save a lot of money. And there is a storage space too. Beautiful and nicely done,0,4
1774,0,It sounds nice but some of the amenities aren't of any use to me and my preference isn't to be on the third floor. I have a little wiggle room but not a huge amount.,0,0
1775,0,"Ok, how about if I'll pay the bills for you?",0,5
1776,0,"Well, give me numbers. What type of numbers are we talking about?",0,0

1785,0,Nice truck! Can we negotiate on the price?,0,0
1786,0,Hello,0,0
1787,0,"Hi! Can you come down on the price a little? The mileage isn't listed and this could be a concern later down the road. Can we start negotiations at $23,000?",0,0
1788,0,Dude... you are trying to lowball me before you even ask me anything about the truck... that is kind of disrespectful...,0,0
1789,0,I'm sorry if you see it that way. Can you please tell me more about it? I'm definitely not trying to low ball you at all!,0,3
1790,0,"I'm asking $27000 for the truck, and I would need cash only as the ad states. It is an 8 speed automatic, with 5.7 hemi engine. It has never been off road. It is in great condition.",0,0
1791,0,"I'm definitely interested but you haven't really listed the condition of the truck or mileage but I'm totally willing to work with you on it. Would you take $24,000 cash for it?",0,5

1793,0,"It's not listed on the ad. Would you take $24,300? I'll come pick it up today.",0,5

1796,0,Hello,0,0
1797,0,"Great, do you have any questions?",0,0

1799,0,"It is in great condition, nice and clean. The paint and tires are perfect. It is only 6months old",0,0
1800,0,"Ok sounds good, just what I was looking for. I can bring you $700 cash right now.",0,3
1801,0,"Well as the ad says, the price is pretty firm at $1350 ...",0,3
1802,0,Yeah I saw that but it is a used bike and I don't know who had it before you and how good they took care of it. Also you could have the cash in your hand today and I would be glad to come pick it up and load it myself,0,5
1803,0,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price.",0,0
1804,0,"Well people may be hesitant to buy with you selling it so soon, they might wonder why you want to get rid of it? I can do $1000 cash and I'll pick up!",0,5

1814,0,That is a little over my budget. I have excellent credit and can put down a deposit in cash. Would you be willing to consider $2000?,0,7
1815,0,I'm sorry but for this unit and in the area that price is too low. I can work with you and let this work for $3000 which is still very low!,0,4
1816,0,What if I pay an extra $500 on the deposit? Could you do $2700?,0,3
1817,0,This is still very low for this town house. $2900 is the lowest I can go,0,6
1818,0,Ok well I can take the $2900 but without the extra deposit money,0,5
