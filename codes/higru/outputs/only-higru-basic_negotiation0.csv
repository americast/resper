310,0,"No it doesn't, I just said my best offer was 41k and you offer less? Can you do better than 41000 or not?",3,0
311,0,"No, not unless you offer some incentive. Can I have a 500 dollar rebate?",6,6
312,0,"No there's no rebate I can offer you, why would I offer a rebate just to give the money back to you? You don't make any sense at all I'm afraid we can't reach a deal.",1,3

342,0,"Since $3300 is your budget, how would $3375 work for you?",4,4
343,0,Is there a security deposit too,5,0

388,0,there are many amenities the garage is extra.  There is a shared pool.,0,0
389,0,"Well, the price is pretty steep considering that a garage is not included and I am assuming there is no utilities included. The unit is quite small. I could do $1700",2,2
390,0,I can include utilities for 2000.00,6,4
391,0,That is still a little steep considering how small this unit is. I would really have to do some downsizing to be able to move it. I am very interested in it though. Can you do any better on the price?,2,2
392,0,Well since it is a brand new property with secured entry and controlled access I can offer one month free on storage with no utilities paid for 1950.00,6,2

405,0,Yes it is. It is 2250 a month with a year lease and you get 1 month off move in with the lease.,0,0

407,0,"Yes they are. Cats are allowed with extra deposit , dogs aren't",0,0
408,0,I see. Would you be willing to take 1500/mo for the unit?,4,4

417,0,"I worry about these old bikes, though. I don't want it to fall apart on her right after she gets it. Can you come down on the price at all?",1,2
418,0,I still use the bike on regular basis so I can assure you that it won't fall apart. We can test drive it when you are here to pick it up. How much are you thinking?,0,0
419,0,"I was looking to spend closer to $100. But if you can take it in for a tune-up before I buy it, I might be able to spend a little more.",6,4
420,0,"No problem. I can do it. However, I need at least $130 to let it go",4,3
421,0,You couldn't come down to $120? That'll be half of my paycheck for this week. I work a part-time job while I'm in school and don't have a ton of disposable income.,7,7

455,0,"Nope, just regular maintenance.",0,0

566,0,What are you looking for in terms of a security deposit?,5,0
567,0,well on average with good credit we get 387 however lowering the rent that much may push you into a thousand,0,4

585,0,"Okay, would you say the amp works perfectly?",5,5
586,0,"Yes, it's extremely loud. I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?",0,0
587,0,I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.,4,2

597,0,I am taking it out for $50. I can give it to you for $45. This costed me more than what I expected to be made. They're custom molded around the latch and the inside of the tailgate. The box is going to fit in most vehicles universally.,0,6
598,0,How about $20?,4,4
599,0,That's too low. The last I can do is $40,3,3
600,0,$25?,4,4
601,0,I can do $40 last,3,0
602,0,$30?,4,0
603,0,$40 is last,3,0
604,0,I'll have to think about it some more then.,4,0
605,0,"Tell you what, I can give it to you for $35 but then you will have to come pick it up! I wouldn't be able to deliver it ti you.",6,6
606,0,Sure that's fine.,0,0
607,0,Hello! I am very much interested in purchasing this bike. Do you have it only in blue color?,5,5
608,0,"Yes, I only have to one bike and it is blue. It was recently painted so there are no defects in the paint",0,0
609,0,"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",7,7
610,0,I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.,2,2
611,0,$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,7,7
612,0,What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.,4,6
613,0,I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,6,6
614,0,That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.,6,2
615,0,I cannot go beyond $150.,3,3
616,0,"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties.",3,3
617,0,How about $180 and I can come get it from you right away?,6,6
618,0,Ok. for $180 that would work.,0,3
619,0,I'm interested in this but is there anything wrong with it?,1,1
620,0,"No there's nothing wrong with it at all. It's brand new, never been used.",0,0
621,0,And will I be able to use it on any phone service?,5,5
622,0,Yes it can be used on all carriers.,0,0
623,0,I would like to buy this for 540 today.,4,4
624,0,That's not what they are going for. They are going for 850 and I'm selling them for 780 to sell them faster.,4,2
625,0,"I cannot pay that much. I have seen most closer to 600, which is more in my price range.",7,4
626,0,"Check again, most of them are selling for 850, this is the 128 GB version not the lower ones. I can go down to 750 but that's it.",4,7
627,0,How about 720?,4,4
628,0,740 and we have a deal.,4,3
629,0,Okay deal,0,0
630,0,Hello,0,0
631,0,Hello! So you're looking for an apartment?,0,0
632,0,No the house,0,0
633,0,"I'm sorry, that's what I meant. I have a great single family house for rent that I think would be perfect for you.",0,0
634,0,But you don't know me,0,0
635,0,This house is perfect for everyone.,0,0
636,0,"You mean anyone. Anyways, don't worry I'm interested.",0,1
637,0,What price were you looking to pay?,0,0
638,0,"Free, I'm only kidding honey. Listen, I'm wondering if this community is diverse. I'm a single gay father, and I just divorced my wife. Are you still sure this place is perfect for anyone?",1,0
639,0,"Yes sir, this is a nice house for rent in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are two large master bedrooms and two other single bedrooms with a total of three bathrooms. The house is great for a small family.",2,0
640,0,"Right, but I'm not really in a family anymore. I will have my daughter occasionally, is it near schools?",5,1
641,0,It's easily walkable to schools.,0,0
642,0,"Oh that's nice. I work from home, I'm making a new business so I was thinking it could double as a place to work out of. I don't think with the divorce I will be able to pay what you want.",7,1
643,0,"The house is listed at $3500 per month, but there's a special going on right now for $2900 per month. I take it that's a bit out of your price range?",4,0
644,0,"Honey, everything is out of my price range. My wife is Christian. My daughter is 14 and not into having a gay father. Anyways, this house has what I need to be a responsible father in contemporary society. Maybe we could do a 6 month lease at one price and then negotiate further. I have immaculate credit.",6,7
645,0,Sounds great. Make an offer.,0,0
646,0,"Right now, I now I could give you 2000 per month easy...",4,0
647,0,That works well.,0,0
648,0,Great!,0,0
649,0,Hello I'm interested in your apartment. Can you tell me if an extra deposit is required?,5,5
650,0,We do require a deposit based on your credit up to 1 months rent plus a $500 non-refundable deposit if you have cats.,0,0
651,0,Okay that's possible. And utilities are they included?,5,5
652,0,"We do include gas, electric, water and trash in the rental price.  There is also wi-fi available in the common areas.",0,0
653,0,That's super. I'm really hoping we can come down on the price a bit. This is a great place it's just a little out of my comfortable budget at the moment. I'd be stretching it at this price. Are you willing to come down on the price?,7,7
654,0,Well we do have a special if you sign a 2 year lease we are offering $200 off your rent which would make it $2450.,6,6
655,0,I really need it to be lower. Otherwise I'm going to be cutting into my essential needs like grocery budget.,7,7
656,0,Well what price were you looking for?,0,0
657,0,In an ideal world where I don't have to struggle at all. It would be 1800 (in a super ideal world it would be 200 per month).,4,3
658,0,"Well I can't go quite that low, that is the price of our 1 bedrooms and this is a 3 bed 2 bath unit.  I will let you in on a little secret, this Saturday we are having a grand re-opening and running a special 2000 a month and no deposit on approved credit.  Would that work better for you?",4,2
659,0,Yes that's possible. Do you really do this for a living? You are quite good at it. Thank-you.,0,0
660,0,Hello.,0,0
661,0,Hi there!,0,0
662,0,Are you interested in my home that I have for sale?,0,0
663,0,"Yes, the home is in a great location and seems to fit my needs wonderfully.",0,0
664,0,Great!  The price is $3175.,0,0
665,0,I'd like to offer $2857. I need to factor in the fact that it is a more dated model and that it will need some updating on my end.,2,2
666,0,I understand what you are saying.  I could offer $2999.  Will that work.,4,4
667,0,$2899 is the highest I am willing to go.,3,3
668,0,$2899 sounds fine.  Deal!! Thank you.,0,0
669,0,Thank you.,0,0
670,0,"Hello there, i'm very interested in the device, but I'm not sure I can afford it. Would you be willing to accept a lower offer?",7,0
671,0,Hi there! Yes I am open to negotiating :),0,0
672,0,I'm assuming this phone doesn't have any damage as you state it is relatively new. It's in good working order then?,5,0
673,0,Yes it is absolutely in a good working condition and has no scratches or anything. It was always used with the cover and its as new.,0,0
674,0,"Great, well I'm a bit strapped for cash, so how about $25 in cash.",7,4
675,0,Woah! That's too too low. I am selling it for 70$. I can go up to $65,4,2
676,0,I wouldn't have enough money left over for other things at that price. Could you take $40,7,4
677,0,I can take $50,4,4
678,0,Fine will go with $45 but I will give you without the cover then!,6,6
679,0,Ok,0,0
680,0,Hello,0,0
681,0,"Hi there, I am interested in the LG Viper.",0,0
682,0,Great! It is in superb condition. I've had it for about a year and I am a fairly light user.,0,0
683,0,It looks like it's in good condition. The only issue is that I really need a phone and I don't have $55 on my today. I was wondering if you'd be willing to negotiate on the price a little bit?,7,4
684,0,Depends what you have?,0,0
685,0,I'd really like to pay $45.,4,4
686,0,Why don't we go with the middle and call it at $50?,4,2
687,0,Does it come with a charger?,5,5
688,0,"Yeah, charger, screen protector already on, and an extra battery.",0,0
689,0,Hmm. Will you agree on $48?,4,4
690,0,"Nah, 50",3,4
691,0,"Ok, $40 is fine.",0,0
692,0,No,0,0
693,0,"I mean to type $50 lol, sorry.",0,0
694,0,lol,0,0
695,0,"Hey, I'm interested in the house bu there seems to be some issues.",1,0
696,0,What issues do you have?,0,0
697,0,"Well first of all, I don't quite like how it's a row of rooms, there's no width to the house. There's little grass, and the place does not look wheelchair accessible.",1,1
698,0,"Well, you're definitely right on the money there. We do not have any kind of ramp or alternative method for handicapped people",0,0
699,0,"So due to all these problems, I'll have to ask you to come down to 1600.",4,2
700,0,I will not be able to bring it down that much,4,6
701,0,Well can you install a wheelchair ramp?,6,6
702,0,"We can install a wheelchair ramp, for sure, to ensure both the front and back entrances are wheelchair accessible",6,0
703,0,"Okay, so can you come down to $1900?",4,4
704,0,That would still be cutting the price in half; can't bring it down that much. The lowest we can bring it down to is $3000,3,3
705,0,"I can do $2600 but not any more, sorry.",3,3
706,0,We can make $2600 work,0,3
707,0,Hello,0,0
708,0,Hi! I am interested in your truck. How is the paint?,5,5
709,0,"Paint is great, not a single scratch or ding.",0,0
710,0,"Great! I would be willing to do 600, on account of the fact that it is pretty high mileage.",2,4
711,0,I'm not sure what you mean. The price it is listed at is $8900. I can negotiate the price a bit though if you are able to pick it up right away.,6,6
712,0,"I am sorry, I meant 6000. I can come get it today with cash in hand for 6230. How does that sound?",6,6
713,0,Hmmm that's really low...,4,4
714,0,"Not really, the pickup is almost 13 years old and the high mileage means that I am bound to have some engine problems not too long after buying it.",1,2
715,0,"The engine was rebuilt and is in good condition, you shouldn't have any problems with it. It is a great truck and has many good years left on her. If we were talking about a car just for tooling around yeah it might be high but for a truck that can haul what this truck can, you won't find a better deal out there.",2,2
716,0,"Still, the wear and tear is there. I with just a 4.8 Liter engine I doubt how much hauling it can really do. I can do 7000, but that is it.",3,2
717,0,"Alright, $7000 is a fair compromise, I can do that.",0,0
718,0,"Hi, are you interested in my dope bike?",0,0
719,0,"Hello, I may be interested in your BMX bike you have for sale.",0,0
720,0,"Its an awesome bike, what is your offer",0,0
721,0,"Considering it needs a new chain and the brake cable is missing, I think $60 is a fair offer.",4,2
722,0,"If you throw in something else to sweeten the deal, im in.",4,6
723,0,"I dont know what I could throw in, its going to be for my son and I would have to still take the bike to have a chain and cable put on so he could ride it.",7,2
724,0,Do you have any old Hoobastank CDs? I'm a collector,4,6
725,0,"No, I am not in for trades, I can do cash only.",3,3
726,0,The only way im going below $90 is with a trade added in. My asking price is $90 and i could buy at least 45 hoobastank CDs with that amount,6,3
727,0,"Ok, well I see another bike in better condition for cheaper so I will go with the other. thanks for your time.",1,0
728,0,Thanks for viewing the listing.,0,0
729,0,No problem. I'm interested. Do you have any one bedroom apartments?,5,5
730,0,"Yes, we do have one bedroom apartments. Any other questions?",0,0
731,0,"Well, the price is pretty high, can we bring it down to a more reasonable price. It's just me and 1875 is too steep for me.",4,7
732,0,How would $1800 work? Or would you need lower?,4,4
733,0,"Still way too high. I was thinking 1,100.",4,4
734,0,I can't go as low as $1100. What about $1500?,4,4
735,0,The most I can go is 1300.,3,3
736,0,$1350 and we have a deal,4,3
737,0,We can do that.,0,0
738,0,"hello, are you interested in this gorgeous, antique table?",0,0
739,0,"Yes, it's quite beautiful, but it's a little expensive... Would you be willing to go lower?",4,4
740,0,what price were you thinking?,0,0
741,0,Is $70 too low?,4,4
742,0,"I can take 100, if you pick up.",6,6
743,0,Does it come with any chairs?,5,5
744,0,"It doesn't come with any chairs but, I do have some chairs I was going to throw out that went with another table that I will give you until you find matching ones for this table.",6,0
745,0,"Will you take $90 for the old chairs, the table, and me coming to pick it up?",6,6
746,0,"90 will work for me, pick up tonight at 7?",0,6
747,0,"Sounds good, I will see you then!",0,0
748,0,Hi,0,0
749,0,Yes I am interested in your iPhone.,0,0
750,0,"Great. I'm selling it for $375, but there's a little room to negotiate.",4,0
751,0,Great. Is there any scratches?,1,1
752,0,No. It's fully functional and in great condition.,0,0
753,0,Does it come with a sim card?,5,5
754,0,Yeah. It's with AT&T. It comes with 64gb RAM too.,0,0
755,0,I want to make an offer of $325.,4,4
756,0,"I was hoping to get a little more for it, if at all possible.",4,4
757,0,How about $350?,4,4
758,0,Great! Sold for $350,0,0
759,0,"Hi, are you interested in this item?",0,0
760,0,Yes I am. Are they still avaible?,0,0
761,0,Yes.,0,0
762,0,"Ok great. I have Verizon, will the phones be able to be activated with my service?",5,5
763,0,"Yes, but I should warn you that there is a little damage to the phone. It is still in pretty good condition though.",0,0
764,0,Yes I read that in your description. They both still look good though. Do either phones have a charger with them?,5,5
765,0,Yes and I will give it to you at no additional cost.,0,0
766,0,Perfect. So I really need these phones today. Will you $85 if I come pick them up from you?,6,6
767,0,"Yes, that works for me.",0,0
768,0,Ok awesome thanks,0,0
769,0,No problem,0,0
770,0,Hi there!,0,0
771,0,This is in perfect condition and was only used for about 6 months before I upgraded.,0,0
772,0,"Ok, that's great. What networks will this phone work with?",5,5
773,0,It works with the sprint network as it sits but I know a guy that can open it if you want it for another network.,0,0
774,0,Hmm... and the screen is not cracked right? The buttons work fine as well?,1,1
775,0,Not even any scratches on it.  It is in perfect condition and looks brand new.,0,0
776,0,How much storage does it have?,5,5
777,0,It is 16 gb.,0,0
778,0,Awesome. So how much do you want for this phone?,0,0
779,0,I am asking $99 but I will drop it to $79 if you bring me some lunch when you come to get it.,6,6
780,0,"Hmm. That is a really good offer. I'll go with that deal but for $69 instead, how about that?",4,4
781,0,That works.,0,0
782,0,These are beautiful! But the price is so high. Would they even consider half of that?,4,0
783,0,Well we do have discounts for Active Military and Seniors.,0,0
784,0,We are seniors and we love the are and the fact that washers and dryers are in most of them. Off 80 is perfect for us. What is the senior discount?,5,6
785,0,Seniors get $300 off Making it around 1300,0,4
786,0,Shoot that is still too high. But I really want to come and look. Is there any other discounts available? I can go to 1250.00,4,7
787,0,Were you ever in the Military?  We do have some Veteran discounts,6,2
788,0,yes my husband was but can that be used on top of the other discount?,4,0
789,0,Will it be you and your husband in the unit then?,0,0
790,0,yes,0,0
791,0,I will go ahead and make a special arrangement for you then at $1250.,0,6
792,0,Hi there! Are you interested in the laptop stand?,0,0
793,0,"I am, but I need more information.  How long have you had the stand?  What shape is it in?",5,1
794,0,It is in excellent condition. I actually got two of them so this one was never used.,0,0
795,0,What did you pay for it originally?,5,5
796,0,$75.00,0,0
797,0,I like the stand and would be interested in it but only have $20 cash.  Can I pick it up today with $20 cash please?,6,6
798,0,I would not be able to let it go that cheap considering what I paid for it originally and it was never used. This stand is solid and will last for many many years so you would get a lot of use out of it.,2,2
799,0,"If I can get $10 more, how would $30 cash be?",4,4
800,0,I will be willing to do that. You will have to pick it up though.,6,6
801,0,I can do that.,0,0

874,0,It sounds pretty heavy. I think I can get a truck to pick it up but I need to know about how much it weighs. Would you say it's larger than 3 feet acros and 6 feet high? I guestimate it about 140 pounds,5,2
875,0,It is about 115 pounds tops,0,4
876,0,So you think you could let it go for $75?,4,4
877,0,I would be able to do 100 the most because it is in great condition and pretty much never been used just was for display at home,2,2
878,0,"Deal, can I pick it up this weekend or do you need to get rid of it right away?",0,6
879,0,I can hold it for you!,0,0
880,0,Hello!  Looks like you're in the market for an amplifier!,0,0
881,0,"Hi, can you tell me how long youu have had the amplifier?",5,5
882,0,"I've had it a year or so.  We got another one and although we could still use this, we don't need two.",0,0
883,0,That makes sense. What kind of accessories come with it?,5,5
884,0,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion.  You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,0,0
885,0,Great. What brand is it?,5,5
886,0,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand.  I'm asking $949 which is below market.,0,0
887,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",7,7
888,0,Oh my.  That's lower than I anticipated.  How about $900?  Would that work?  I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,6,6
889,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",7,6
890,0,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you.  How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",4,4
891,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",4,7
892,0,"If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal.",4,3
893,0,"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",0,6
894,0,Sounds Great!,0,0
895,0,"Hello, are you interested in my phone?",0,0
896,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,1,1
897,0,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,0,0
898,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,1,1
899,0,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",0,0
900,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,4,4
901,0,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",4,4
902,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,7,6
903,0,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",2,2
904,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,0,6
905,0,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",0,3
906,0,Hi. I see your interested in my car?,0,0

912,0,Tires were just replaced and it has new wheels everything is good to go.,0,0
913,0,Sounds like it may be what I'm looking for. I have 6000 in cash I can give you today for it.,4,6
914,0,6500 and I will bring the car to you right now.,6,6
915,0,Sounds like a good deal to me.,0,4
916,0,Hello,0,0
917,0,"Hi, I saw your posing and I would like to buy your San Lorenzo Home.",0,0
918,0,"Great. It is a really great home, lots of space and a very nice quiet neighborhood.",0,0
919,0,That sounds awesome! I see your price is $2600 but that's a little high for me. Would you accept $2340?,7,7
920,0,"I can negotiate the price, sure. Do you have references, and can you provide a security deposit along with first and last month?",4,6
921,0,"Yes, I have a few references; some family and friends. I should also be able to provide a security deposit.",0,0
922,0,If you can provide solid references and have first/last and security we could do $2340 for a short term lease.,6,6
923,0,"Would I be able to extend it, if in the future I want to?",5,4
924,0,Yes but the price would have to be renegotiated at that time.,6,3
925,0,"Ok, that sounds fine. So we have a deal for $2340?",0,4
926,0,Hey I am interested in renting this place if it is still available?,0,0
927,0,It sure is as of now anyways,0,0
928,0,I have 10 classmates and myself and this place would be perfect as it is close to campus.,0,1
929,0,It sounds like you need all the room you can get. Do you have any questions about it?,0,0
930,0,Does it include any ammenities?,5,5
931,0,"Oh absolutely! It is Cable/DSL Ready , 2 blocks from campus and  1.5 blocks from Telegraph avenue, it has 2 full bathrooms, washer/Dryer unit, On-Site office management team and it is a clean well-run apartment building. It has a brand new kitchen as well.",0,0
932,0,Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water.  We are poor graduate students.,7,6
933,0,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want.",3,2
934,0,Okay we will take it.,0,0
935,0,Awesome! Thank you for everything,0,0

940,0,I bought it less than 1 year ago but I think it's not much older than that.,0,0
941,0,Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen.  Would you be interested in it?,4,4
942,0,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?",5,4
943,0,as far as I know it does.  The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke.  My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,0,2
944,0,Can you get those screens repaired?,4,0
945,0,Yeah it does cost around $75 but the phone is worth around $200,4,0
946,0,"Oh cool, okay how much are you wanting to pay for the amp and the phone?",0,0
947,0,well I was thinking with the phone I could add $25 cash.,6,0
948,0,"That seems like a good deal to me, thank you!",0,0
949,0,Hello. How are you?,0,0
950,0,"Hi, I'm great thanks, I was interested in our listing. It is difficult to judge without a photo, can you tell me about it?",5,0
951,0,It is brand new never been used! Never been sat on it is black and orange.,0,0
952,0,How come you're getting rid of it?,1,5
953,0,I ended up not using it nor needing it.,0,0

955,0,Nothing wrong with it got the receipt everything is new never used been sitting in my garage.,0,0
956,0,How long ago did you buy it?,5,5
957,0,About three weeks ago.,0,0
958,0,Seems a little weird there is no photo and you supposedly bought it new just a few weeks ago...seems you could just return it to the store...,1,1
959,0,You can come see it today. I could return it but do not have time to take it just trying to sell it to someone who needs it.,0,0
960,0,"Well if I were buying a new bike for full price I'd got to the bike shop and get it with a warranty and knowing that it isn't stolen or something. Would you be willing to meet at the police station , they have a setup where they run a check on things sold on the internet to make sure they haven't been reported stolen. If we could meet there , I could do $3200 cash for the bike.",6,2
961,0,Yes we can meet there with no problems. I could accept that offer also. Can be there whenever you want to meet today.,0,6
962,0,"Great, see you soon",0,0

966,0,I actually and not looking for trades but we can still make a deal,4,4
967,0,If I come up with $1000 dollars could we do that? I offer to come pick it up too.,6,6
968,0,If you can pay $1200 I can bring it to you!,6,6
969,0,Would you include the work station the bike is mounted on? My wife would kill me if I do not have any extras that come with it.,6,1
970,0,"The work station no, but I can let the bike go for $1150 TAKE IT",6,3
971,0,I'd do $1150 if you could include a helmet or bike pump at least. Or any extra tubes you may have laying around.,6,6

1454,0,"No, sorry, too low.  There is a washer/dryer hook up.",2,2

1469,0,"automatic , it's really great",0,0
1470,0,"perfect. I am very interested in purchasing this vehicle, since this is a car you no longer need and since it is such high mileage are you willing to negotiate on the price. The listed price is just a little above my budget.",7,2
1471,0,"ok we can work something out, what can you do",0,0
1472,0,I'm concerned about any repairs and maintenance that I may have to do. I'm looking closer to the 2100.00 price range,2,6

1474,0,"I'm not sure If I can do much more, while it looks great I would need to be able to take the car to a mechanic that I trust in order to go much higher than this. Without the most I could go is 2500",2,4

1506,0,I have my own and am looking for someone who is looking for a phone that is in excellent condition.,0,0
1507,0,"I'm interested, but $650 is what AT&T charges for the phone new from the store. For that price I get a warranty and know for sure that it's never been dropped, used, stolen, etc. Would you consider selling it for $400? I checked online and that seems to be the going rate.",2,2
1508,0,That might be a bit too low. Would you be willing to pay 500 dollars for it?,4,4
1509,0,Do you have any accessories that you could include?,0,5

1512,0,"Yes, and I will throw that in for free as well. So, do we have a deal? 500 dollars.",6,6
1513,0,If you throw in a case and SD card I'll do $450.,6,6
1514,0,Even better. I will do that. 450. Is it a deal?,0,4
1515,0,Sounds good!,0,0
1516,0,I am interested in the apartmnet,0,0
1517,0,It is still available and quite beautiful. What questions do you have?,0,0
1518,0,"None really, i have seen it before when a friend lived there. I know for a fact that the rent advertised is much higher than what he pays",2,1
1519,0,Well this is one of the upgraded units with carpeting and AC. The rent is quite fair. Can I ask what he pays?,2,0
1520,0,"He has an upgraded unit and pays 1200. I understand rent has gone up in the past 2 years, so i am willing to pay 1350",2,2
1521,0,I think your friend might be lying about his rent.,2,0

1523,0,Feel free to make me an offer.,4,0

1531,0,"Nice, the only reason I ask is because i'm looking at the photo and the leather looks like it's sagging a bit. I mean it shouldn't be a huge deal but it'll cost me out of pocket to get it refitted. could you possibly accept $200 for the sofa and loveseat?",2,2
1532,0,"They are genuine leather, and they truly are in very good condition. $200 is a bit too low. The lowest I want to go is $280.",2,2
1533,0,What if we meet halfway on this at $240. Also would you be able to drop this off for me? I'm local but I don't have access to a pickup truck.,6,6
1534,0,I am willing to do $260 with delivery included,6,6

1544,0,I just bought a new car when this one started acting up and need it gone as I have no use for it anymore.,0,2
1545,0,"Acting up with only 50,000 miles, you must be a mechanic. Well, I'll give you 6300",2,6
1546,0,Well I was really looking to get 7000 out of it could you do 6800?,4,4
1547,0,fine,0,0

1550,0,"Great, so no stains, correct?",5,0
1551,0,"There are no stains, the mattress had a cover on it while in use and I have also taken the time to have it cleaned with steam and anti-bacterial cleaner solution.",0,0
1552,0,"Wow, that is awesome. I am really interested in buying the bed, but the price is a little too high for me. What is the lowest you are willing to take?",7,4
1553,0,"If you can pick it up, I will drop that price to $250 just for you. Are you also interested in the free sheets and comforter?",6,6
1554,0,"That is still too high for me. I am about to start at the local university, and all I have is $140 to spend",7,7
1555,0,"Oh wow, that is substantially lower than what I'd like to sell it for. If I do $140 will you help me move into my new apartment? It should only take 3 hours and I have a moving truck but nobody to help.",6,6
1556,0,I absolutely can! sounds like a great deal!,0,0
1557,0,"Wow, awesome!",0,0

1577,0,"Wow, any way to get that closer to 1,000?",4,4
1578,0,"I think you would agree that it's a steal even at $1861.  I could come down to $1700, but did want to mention we cover the heat, water, and garbage bills, so that's money you'll save every month.",2,6
1579,0,"How about 1,500 and I pay the fist month in cash?",6,6
