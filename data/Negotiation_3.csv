3994,C_07380e3ca3364ce29f876d28e44a63d8,0,Hi I am very interested in the bike,
3995,C_07380e3ca3364ce29f876d28e44a63d8,1,"Yes, do you have questions? It is a great bike.",
3996,C_07380e3ca3364ce29f876d28e44a63d8,0,This bike takes me back. I had one years ago.,
3997,C_07380e3ca3364ce29f876d28e44a63d8,1,"well come and scoopit up, it is $250.",
3998,C_07380e3ca3364ce29f876d28e44a63d8,0,My budget is a little tight. Would you consider $220?,

4015,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Hi interested in renting a new apartment?,
4016,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,I am! This looks like it has everything I need. Is the cable included in the price?,
4017,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Unfortunately not the wording is possibly slightly misleading our apartments are cable ready meaning once you contact one of the local cable companies and negotiate a package it is very simple for them to setup. We do have a contract with xfinity for a flat $50 basic HD package not included in rent.,
4018,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Oh well that is still a pretty good deal. The swimming pool and saunas are included in the rent though?,
4019,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Certainly those are included ammenities of our community that every resident has access too at the designated times. You may also purchase a pool key for $15 dollars however we ask that you please leave the pool by 11pm,
4020,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Then just one last question. Can you have a washer and dryer in your apartment?,
4021,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Yes you are more than welcome to use your own or rent a pair from us for no more than $25 extra in rent. However do note if you do use your own you would be held responsible from any damages that may occur due to an unfortunate malfunction.,
4022,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,All sounds good to me. I would like to pay 1350,
4023,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Unfortunately that is not acceptable for our community. I can do 1800 while also throwing in a free pool key,
4024,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Okay I'll take that.,
4025,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Thank you very much we look forward to having you live with us.,

5128,C_0f7c8ec53ee8428487d870eeb2f394f4,0,I was kinda hoping on spending $200 on a chair for my room.,
5129,C_0f7c8ec53ee8428487d870eeb2f394f4,1,Ok. I would be willing to sell for $230. That's not that far from what you were hoping for. Would you be willing to accept $230? This chair is in good shape and it's almost new,
5130,C_0f7c8ec53ee8428487d870eeb2f394f4,0,I would be willing to pay the $230 cash if you can deliver it.,

5210,C_d20f00c9e1e24eb7bd4c4a8c9c96e5b8,1,Yep it's in excellent condition,
5211,C_d20f00c9e1e24eb7bd4c4a8c9c96e5b8,0,That's really great to hear. I'm a huge music fan and I would really like to grab this speaker for myself because I currently listen on laptop speakers that are awful. What do you think about giving em to me for $75?,
5212,C_d20f00c9e1e24eb7bd4c4a8c9c96e5b8,1,how about $100 and I'll deliver .,
5213,C_d20f00c9e1e24eb7bd4c4a8c9c96e5b8,0,"That's really nice, but I could drive over there and back myself if you give them to me for $85",

5273,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"Hi, I am interested but have afew questions...",
5274,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,sure :),
5275,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,is the reserved parking spot covered?,
5276,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,yes it is covered by a carport. We also have garages avaliable for an additional fee. The garages are not attached to the apartment itself but they are within the building and have an entryway so you won't have to walk outside in the elements to get to your garage.,
5277,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"I just wanted a covered spot, though the garage sounds nice , I am on a budget. I was also curious as to your pet policy..?",
5278,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,pets are allowed with a $100 deposit for dogs over 40lbs and $50 for cats and small dogs.,
5279,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"I see. well like I said I am interested but on a budget any chance I can get it at a discount, say $1712",
5280,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,"I cannot go that low, the lowest I can go is 2100. Did I mention utilities (water, gas, sewer, electricity) are included? We also have all brand new appliances in the our units as well as new flooring throughout.",
5281,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"It all sounds so lovely, anyway you can waive the pet fee if I do it at 2100?",
5282,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,I can't waive the deposit but I can spread the deposit out over 1 year making rent $2108.34/month for the first year.,
5283,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,I only have one cat.. no way you can do 2100?,
5284,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,oh I realize I didn't even ask what type of animal. I have to keep a deposit in case your cat messes up the apartment. 2101 (making it a $12 deposit spread out over the year),
5285,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"alright, fair enough",

5331,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,25 is a bit more than I wanted to spend. Is this used or new?,
5332,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,This is new. I just happened to get two coffee makers for my birthday so i'm getting rid of this one cheap.,

5591,C_6fe4a18e6eb3440988d3f9353f738718,0,"Yeah, I have to agree, it is a great apartment, but it is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you come down $25 per month to $1425?",
5592,C_6fe4a18e6eb3440988d3f9353f738718,1,Sure I can do it at 1425. Is it a deal then.,

6092,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Yes. What kind of condition is it in and does it have any mechanical problems?,
6093,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,It's in really great condition. It has 106k miles but these are mostly highway miles so the engine runs like it's lower miles than that.,
6094,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Okay then. The price is a little high are you willing to negotiate?,
6095,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,I can negotiate a little bit but that's really a pretty reasonable price already. What were you thinking?,
6096,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Are you willing to go down to 8000?,
6097,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,"No that is way too low, it's worth much more than that. How about 13500?",
6098,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,That is too high. I don't think it's worth that much given the mileage. How about 10500,
6099,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,Since the engine is in really good condition that would really be too low. 12500 is the lowest I can go.,
6100,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Okay that sounds fair.,
6113,C_099cd87933424fd195687cc59f11df04,1,Hi! are you interested in the bike?,

6117,C_099cd87933424fd195687cc59f11df04,1,"Sure! At this point, it's really priced to a specialist who can appreciate the rarity of a model in this good of condition. The bike itself is a joy to ride and the fact that you won't have to do any repairs is a bonus.",
6118,C_099cd87933424fd195687cc59f11df04,0,alright. would you consider 800 bucks?,
6119,C_099cd87933424fd195687cc59f11df04,1,Hmm...I can do $900 if you can come pick it up?,

6138,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,Hi! I hear you're interested in the Santa Clara apartment,
6139,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,Yes it looks beautiful. Is there a backyard?,
6140,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,There's no individual backyard but there's a communal outdoors area that you won't be responsible for maintaining!,
6141,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,That's great. The wife and kids will love that. Does it come fully furnished?,
6142,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"No, you'll be responsible for furnishing it yourself.",
6143,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,"Hmm that may be a problem with all of those steps we need to climb. The bed, the grand piano, the grandfather clock...",
6144,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,No worries! It's a first-floor apartment,
6145,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,Why was the unit extensively remodeled after only 2 years? Was there some sort of damage?,
6146,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"Not particularly. We like to replace all carpets after tenants who have pets -- even if there is not extensive damage, we find new tenants enjoy the brand-new features. If you think you might be interested in a tour, we can set something up?",
6147,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,We can but the price seems a bit steep for only 2 bedrooms. I know the asking price is $2595 but would $2000 be doable?,
6148,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"Sorry, no. That's much too low for the area. I'm confident we'll have interest in the apartment at $2595. I can drop it as low as $2495.",
6208,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,"Hi, I had asked for a phone number in my ad, but suppose we can chat here instead.",

6213,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,0,A new one actually goes for a little bit less. How about $5 for it,
6214,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,that is far too low. this is fair market value price at 18 I am willing to come down to $15.,
6215,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,0,I can meet you halfway and offer you $9.50,
6216,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,No I am sorry that is too big a loss for me. I would do 13.50 but that is my ultimate final low price.,

6254,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,1,"Yes. Let me tell you something. The location is close to San Francisco, a high rent area, so it should help you out. Price has been lowered to $2950, so it should be a good deal.",
6255,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,0,Do you allow pets and does that include the deposit?,
6256,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,1,Yes of course.,
6257,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,0,"Okay the price seems pretty high for that area. Other apartments in that area are going for much lower. Can you go down to $1,500",
6258,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,1,"No that is way to low. That's almost half off. And I live here and I'm doing a you a favor lowering it that much.We can do $2800, but that's as flexible as I can get unfortunately.",
6259,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,0,"I actually double-checked and your asking price is much higher than comparable apartments in that area. I could maybe go up to $2,000",

6261,C_73b60ca295014317bd5b2404515146e9,0,If you can do 2200 then we have a deal,

6306,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,1,"No, I'm sorry, but the home is for rent, not for sale.",
6307,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,0,ok well can you do 1750? 3500 is a bit high for a 3 bedroom,
6308,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,1,"Friend, this is a high quality home in a very desirable neighborhood. Frankly, I'm not sure why I'm letting it go for $3500. It would be a steal at $4000 a month!",
6309,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,0,"thats not a steal because i have to pay security deposit as well, i would basically be paying your mortgage and adding extra money in your pocket,thats a rip off!",
6310,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,1,"Well, you know what they say, being rich enough to rent out a house in California means you get to be cruel, it's just a perk of being rich.  Now, I suppose I could come down to $3,000 a month, that's only $39,000 a year to live in this wonderful neighborhood.",
6311,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,0,well what is the school district like? is it A rated?,
6312,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,1,"Yes, the schools in this area are some of the best. I'll tell you what, because it's clear you're interested in the house because you want to spend time hanging around the local schools, I'll drop the price down to $2850 a month.",
6313,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,0,I have children to think about and if i am going to pay that much for rent i want to make sure i dont have to send them to private school too because the public school in our area is bad. But if you can do 2000 we have a deal,
6314,C_ca843c523609489b8964bdbf9a4906c4,1,"Okay, you're cutting my throat, but I'll come down to $2,250 a month.",

6321,C_fae6964b854b4a7a8f13bb516150b6dc,1,"Beautiful farmer's market if you're into organic produce, it's really nice out here in California. Also, when it gets hotter outside, you'll be able to go to the community park as well as the fairgrounds, and concerts that occur in the park. Finally, there are a variety of other attractions like bars, a winery, a golf course, among other things, if you're older. Also, if you have a car, we obviously include parking.",
6322,C_fae6964b854b4a7a8f13bb516150b6dc,0,What size units do you have available?,
6323,C_fae6964b854b4a7a8f13bb516150b6dc,1,"Unfortunately we're out of the smaller units, which run around 1500; to medium-sized units, which are around 2300, to larger units, which cost around 3300 a month",

6326,C_fae6964b854b4a7a8f13bb516150b6dc,0,I think from the landscape visible that it could be handled with 15 hours a week.,
6381,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,0,"Hey there, nice bike frame",
6382,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,1,"Hi, thanks. Are you interested in purchasing?",
6383,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,0,"Yeah definitely, is it used a lot? Just wondering why sell it, it's so high-end",
6384,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,1,It is not used a lot. I only used it a couple of times but I just don't use it anymore so that is why I'm selling it. It's in pretty great shape.,
6385,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,0,"Alright, well can you tell me a little more about it? My budget's closer to 1000 and it's used, but let me know",
6386,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,1,Well given that it was barely used I think I could drop it down to $1500 for you but $1000 is a little too low for me.,

I'm looking for 490 for it.  I think that's fair as I'm including a 17 inch LCD monitor and two 150MHz probes.  Is this your first Oscilloscope or have you been using one for a while?",
6404,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,0,"It's my first. I've used them in the past, but I've never owned one. They're a bit out of my budget! However, I'm very interested in this one. Would you accept an offer?",
6405,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,1,"I have a little bit of wiggle room, but not too much unfortunately.  When I got this one I went pretty high end.  It has a 100 Mega Samples a sec and can export data to PCs.  It even has internal storage.  What do you think is fair?",
6406,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,0,I was hoping I could get it for $345. I can assure you it'll be put to good use!,
6407,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,1,Hmmm I can't go that low unfortunately.  You said this is your first one.  How about we go 440 and I can spend a couple hours showing you how to use it and can even throw in some replacement parts I have.,
6408,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,0,I understand. How about $400? That's about all I can afford at this time.,
6409,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,1,Do you have an old fishing pole or skis that you don't use any more?  I'm looking for one and would be willing to do 400 if you have something like that I could spend the season using.,
6410,C_1deb23a3e588400ca1795f39a4278e00,0,"Yes! I can spare a fishing pole. So, $400 plus a fishing pole?",

7012,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,"I understand. You did say that you have had them for a few years. It is also only one couch, which i could probably buy brand new for the same price. I was thinking $200.00",
7013,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,Actually it's a couch love seat and two ottomans,
7014,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Well you have only listed 1 couch with the sizes so i assumed it was only 1,

7018,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Well the item is listed at $500.00 which means you are willing to go down lower. So lets say $350.00. This is a few years old so i'm sure it has wear and tear problem areas.,
7019,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,I can do $400 and throw in all the throw pillows and area rug that  you can see in the picture too,

7025,C_bde3bd30413448b9bb98ac2aac3c95cc,1,400 seems a bit too low for me. How about we settle at 500 dollars. That seems reasonable to me. How does that sound?,
7026,C_bde3bd30413448b9bb98ac2aac3c95cc,0,I really can't afford that.  What about $450?,

7236,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,Good and you?,
7237,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,Very well thanks! Are you interested in my offer? Any questions?,
7238,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,"I am! It sounds good but people don't sell vehicles unless something is wrong with them soooo.... what is it's dings, bumps, bruises, quirks?",
7239,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,Nope absolutely nothing wrong with it I am simply upgrading! You are welcome to schedule an appointment to get it checked or take it for a test drive.,
7240,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,That would be perfect! Would you take $2500 for it?,
7241,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,No nothing near that low for a car this nice it only has 60000 miles on it and is in beautiful condition.,
7242,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,It is almost 8 years old and only has 60000 miles??? Did you ever drive it? How about $3000,
7243,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,My commute is only 5 miles and no that is less tham half my offer.,
7244,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,Alright then half of your offer $3500,
7245,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,No i;m afraid you will have to look elsewhere the lowest I'll go is 6000.,
7246,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,At 8 years old the depreciation is 80% from it's original price as well as parts normally wear out between 8 to 10 years so although you may have a beautiful car it will begin to fall apart soon. $6000 is too much for an 8 year old car. I can go $3750,
7332,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,Hello are you still selling the TV?,
7333,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"Indeed. I am. Just installed a new lamp and going for the low, low price of only $275!",
7334,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,What kind of condition is the TV in? Any problems with it?,
7335,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"Works like brand new, and like I said, basically just had it refurbished with the new lamp.",
7336,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,So it says on the listing that it's 10 years old? That price is a little high for such an old TV don't you think?,
7337,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"It was close to $6000 brand new, remember the thing is a 70 incher.",
7338,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,"You can get much newer 70 inch TVs for that price, could you come down a little on it?",
7339,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"For a new TY, at that price you'd be lucky to get a 40 inch Chinese knock off brand at Walmar for that price. But tell you what, I'll toss in free delivery on the JVC.",
7340,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,"I think you are a little off on the pricing still, we're talking about 10 years here not 2 or 3. Would you take 200?",
7341,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,$220 and you do your own pick up.,

7355,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"There's some kind of misfire in the engine I was told it has a dead cylinder, that should be the only issue.",
7356,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,oh ouch and how many miles are on it?,
7357,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,It only has about 66k miles on it.,
7358,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,Well with that problem and the hassle it is going to be to get it registered in the US I could only really offer you $2000 for it.  If I have to replace the motor that is going to cost a fortune.,
7359,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"You don't have to replace the whole engine, I already lowered the price considering the repair cost. Other than the repair it is still pretty new and has a lot of mileage left in it.",
7360,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,"Well I will tell you what, I can do 3,500 but that is only after I have my mechanic look at it.  There is still the hassle of getting it registered here.",
7361,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"Look I can bring it down to 6500 if that helps you out but you might be looking for a way cheaper car, this one might be out of your price range",
7362,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,I'll tell you what I can do 5000 but you have to deliver it to me.  And no it's not too expensive for me I just really don't need it just like it.,
7363,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"6400 and that's my final offer, and you come to pick it up.",
7364,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,keep it have a nice day,

7408,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,Lol. I hope I didn't offend. It's just that the truck is pretty cool so I figured you for the Willie Nelson type.,
7409,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,1,"You're not too far off. And yes the truck is a classic, mostly original too, other than the exhaust and a bit of tuning on the engine.",
7410,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,"Excellent. That's just what I wanted to hear. I have $5,000 cash, how does that sound?",
7411,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,1,That's quite a bit lower than I was looking for. Can you do you $5750?,
7412,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,Hmmmm. How's the interior?,
7413,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,1,"All original, so there's a bit or wear but no cracks in the dash or tears in the upholstery.",
7414,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,Okay. How's $5655?,

7476,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,0,"That's a bit steep for me, and it is used after all. Would you take $100?",
7477,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,1,Do you think you could go up to $175?,
7478,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,0,That's a little more than I would be willing to spend. How does $140 sound?,

7487,C_a8fab516501e499db61378d2a6827415,0,"Anytime is fine, but $4300 is way out of my budget, can we go down to 2100?",

It really is a resort style property with an amazing pool as well as a bbq area that is just amazing.

8295,C_77427a2d2ddc44ab8d9210aa16deacfa,1,It's not my final price but $325 is definitely too low for me to afford right now. I also knocked off $125 off the price already due to the nail polish spill. I am thinking more in the $575-600 range. How does that sound?,
8296,C_77427a2d2ddc44ab8d9210aa16deacfa,0,it is still on the high side. how about $490,
8297,C_77427a2d2ddc44ab8d9210aa16deacfa,1,You drive a hard bargain! How about we meet in the middle at $530 and I'll personally deliver the vanity. I own a truck and my son can come help me move it wherever you'd like!,

8317,C_f70a7a13e06d459abba9114f7b0921f8,1,Very recently! And it has not been used too much!,
8318,C_f70a7a13e06d459abba9114f7b0921f8,0,I would love to buy it then. Would you negotiate a little from your price? Would 250 be okay?,
8319,C_f70a7a13e06d459abba9114f7b0921f8,1,I'll accept 250 if you are willing to meet in person and pick it up in the next two days!,

8332,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,hi there. I am interested in this apartment. I have been looking for one for months now and this one caught my attention. Is the location good?,
8333,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,The location is great,
8334,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,The price doesn't work for me. I am willing to pay about $1540 would it work for you?,
8335,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,That is a substantial amount lower than we are able to go.  The best we could knock off would be around 10%.,
8336,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,What's the final price?,
8337,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,$1980 would be the lowest we can go.  Would you be willing to sign an extended lease at that rate?,
8338,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,I am a student and I can't afford that much. Eventually I would pay more atleast give me a good rate to begin with?,
8339,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,Would you be willing to do any caretaking duties to help off set cost?,
8340,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,Yes sure can do that!,
8341,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,Would 1600 a month be doable and then 30 hours a month of caretaking duties (which equates to $20 an hour),
8342,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,yes that's perfect! Will go with that! Thanks,

9516,C_7d768826c9d745a8b918e05570f58ecf,0,I don't really need the picture. Do you have chairs that match?,

9519,C_7d768826c9d745a8b918e05570f58ecf,1,"That's tempting; this is 123 inches of polished wood, and very hard and strong.  Will you meet me at $240?",

10225,C_c0ab52bae9884516a9642b0b429eed58,1,2800.00 is an extremely fair price for both the house and the area.  I think 2200.00 is not comparable to the comfort this house will provide your family,

10263,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,1,Sure we could negotiate the price.  But we wouldn't be able to allow pets in that case.,

10688,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,0,I am looking for a 2 bedroom apartment,
10689,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,1,Well I have one how perfect.  It is a beautiful property and better than an apartment because you are going to get your own garage and backyard.  There is also a community pool and clubhouse in the gated community.  We are only asking 1800 a month with an equal deposit,
10690,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,0,Wow.  Sounds great but my budget was under $1000 a month.,

10695,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,1,Well if you would be willing to sign a 2 year lease I could come down as low as 1400 a month and with your great credit I will also be able to waive the security deposit.,
10696,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,0,"I would appreciate the security deposit being waived.  Why don't we meet in the middle, anyway $1,300?",

10735,C_5878f4b1fde94a0e8ae4396c294427d7,0,I could pay 800 a month or what can we work out.,
10736,C_5878f4b1fde94a0e8ae4396c294427d7,1,that is much too low I would take more like 1900 a month. just look at this place its worth a lot more,
10737,C_5878f4b1fde94a0e8ae4396c294427d7,0,I would only be able to pay a max of 1100 a month,
10738,C_5878f4b1fde94a0e8ae4396c294427d7,1,If you can pay $1600 then I would be willing to take that but if you rent the following year I would have to increase the rent to $1800,

12591,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,"Great. $200 seems a bit high, I have been pricing them on Amazon, and since I have prime shipping it would be free and quick. Is there any way you could sweeten the deal? I would be able to pick them up right away.",
12592,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,"Of course I am willing to negotiate for the right price. I am willing to go as low as $185, any lower than that? Probably not. How does that offer sound to you?",
12593,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,$185 is still a bit high considering I would have to come get them. I would like them quicker than amazon's 2 days but only if I could get a really good deal on them.  I was thinking more along the lines of $140,
12594,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,"Tell you what, if you can come get them today—I will let them go for $150. I understand your looking for a good deal, but I'm not going to break myself on this deal.",
12595,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,"That sounds fair. $150 is reasonable, I can do that.",

13663,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,I am the original owner. I've had it for quite some time so it's certainly had its use. There are some very minor cosmetic flaws but the sound quality and functionality is 100%! I don't recall the original manufactured date of this specific model but I can tell it was engineered to last.,

13811,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,No I do not have any pets or children,
13812,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Do you mind telling me how many stains are on the furniture and where?,
13813,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Sure. The stain is very light and it was caused when we tried to move in the furniture to the patio. Its very light and not seen at all. I mentioned it to make sure that when I sell the buyer has the knowledge of it.,
13814,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,How old is the furniture? 550 seems awful high. I saw something at goodwill for less than half of that price that was similar.,

13817,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Wow that's way too low. That's half of what I am selling it off for. I can give it to you for $400,
13818,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,"Maybe 300? Money is awful tight and we just had a house fire, lost everything. And with the baby on the way, I just can't go much higher.",
13819,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,$380 is the last price I can help you with. I need to get my money to get my wife a new couch too so its just fair.,

18137,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,I am the original owner. I've had it for quite some time so it's certainly had its use. There are some very minor cosmetic flaws but the sound quality and functionality is 100%! I don't recall the original manufactured date of this specific model but I can tell it was engineered to last.,
18138,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,Awesome. I want it. I could come and pick it up today. I have $28 cash in hand.,

18180,C_1a1c3e58c9f541de8cbacd07a23aa111,0,I can come pick it up but I can't justify paying more than $4200 for it because of the KBB value.,
18181,C_1a1c3e58c9f541de8cbacd07a23aa111,1,What about $4500?,

18311,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Hi. I am really interested in your furniture. Do you have any pets or children?,
18312,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,No I do not have any pets or children,
18313,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Do you mind telling me how many stains are on the furniture and where?,
18314,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Sure. The stain is very light and it was caused when we tried to move in the furniture to the patio. Its very light and not seen at all. I mentioned it to make sure that when I sell the buyer has the knowledge of it.,
18315,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,How old is the furniture? 550 seems awful high. I saw something at goodwill for less than half of that price that was similar.,
18316,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,"Well the furniture is as new and its a branded one too and I am selling it for half the price of what I had got it for. So 550 is reasonable, but I am willing to negotiate. Give me a price!",
18317,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,I was hoping you would be willing to go 250?,
18318,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Wow that's way too low. That's half of what I am selling it off for. I can give it to you for $400,
18319,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,"Maybe 300? Money is awful tight and we just had a house fire, lost everything. And with the baby on the way, I just can't go much higher.",
18320,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,$380 is the last price I can help you with. I need to get my money to get my wife a new couch too so its just fair.,
18321,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Okay. I think I may have to keep looking unless you will accept 350.,
18322,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Well I can give it to you for 350 its not like 30 dollars is gonna take me anywhere :) Deal!,

18436,C_eecd7fed54424c249ff2fd8f22458c42,0,How about $1399?,
18437,C_eecd7fed54424c249ff2fd8f22458c42,1,I can not go that low due to the mortgage being more than that I can offer to go as low as $1448,
