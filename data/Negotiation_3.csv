1748,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,Hi! I saw your post about the apartment?,
1749,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,"Hello, yes. The rent is $2698 monthly with all the included amenities.",
1750,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,"I have to admit, that stretches my budget to a point of discomfort. I'm not sold on the location. I'll have a bit of a commute.",
1751,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,"If it helps a bit, the apartment would be fully furnished. It really is a great deal especially for the location you will be in.",
1752,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,I don't doubt it. Any chance you'd like to make my day and let me in for 1500?,
1753,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,That is incredibly low and I have other people who are interested. The best offer I could give you would be $2450.,
1754,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,"I know, that was an insult. Forgive me. Tell me a little more about it. . . make me fall in love, and I could do 2200?",
1755,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,"That is not a problem. Well firstly, it is a quiet location. You could be downtown in about 5 minutes just walking. I didn't ask if you have pets. You would have a private yard for them to roam around in. We have a fitness center so you can keep up with your fitness goals. Our entire property was also recently renovated.",
1756,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,You're an excellent salesperson. 2200?,
1757,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,I appreciate that. I can do $2375.,
1758,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,Split the difference? 2287.50? We can round to 2287. ;),
1759,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,1,$2300 and that is the lowest I can accept. Sound good?,
1760,C_67e4101720264981ab1a51cf982c251d,0,Sounds good.,
1810,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,"Hi, how do you feel about the list price of $1800/month?",
1811,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,Hello. I'm interested in the townhouse. Is it still available? If so how long is the lease term?,
1812,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,The lease will be one year.,
1813,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,i really like the town home but a year lease is a bit long--would you be willing to accept 1550?,
1814,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,How long do you plan to stay there?,
1815,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,of  I like the area and tow home I could potentially stay 2-3 years until I finish school,
1816,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,"I'm confused because you said a one year lease is too long, but it seems like you want to stay longer than a year?",
1817,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,"What I mean by a year lease being long is that it's a big commitment since I don't know if I will like the neighborhood, neighbors, management, town home, etc. would you be willing to accept a lower monthly amount? I have excellent credit and have excellent references",
1818,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,"I can accept your offer of 1550 if you either commit to one year, or pay a two months' deposit upfront. Otherwise I'm afraid I can't give you a discount.",
1819,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,Thank you! That is absolutely something I can do. So if.  Derstand we are agreeing on a 1 year lease with a 2 month deposit upfront? This sounds great!,
1820,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,1,"Yes that works for me. So the lease will be a one year commitment, at 1550/month. 3100 deposit will be refunded at move out minus any costs for damages",
1821,C_154841f8d3a940c2b4495b68415b3098,0,Thank you! We have a deal!,
1843,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"Hi, are you interested in the car?",
1844,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,Yes indeed. However there are a few things I'd like to talk about.,
1845,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"OK, ask away.",
1846,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,So this salvage title... what made the small accident so small?,
1847,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,We bought this car at a law enforcement auction. The salvage title means you can't register and drive the car. It'f for parts only. There just a small dent in the rear quarter panel. Otherwise the care is in very good condition and low miles. It's a goldmine for parts.,
1848,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,Could I drive it on private lands without issues?,
1849,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"Oh yeah, you can do that. Just stay off of paroled roads. IT's really just for parts. If you have a body or repair shop, then you can charge what ever you want for the parts.",
1850,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,"In that case I think I'm going to have to cut that price in half there, and meet you at $8375.",
1851,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"I could let it go for $12,500. Could you do that?",
1852,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,"That's still too low partner, we're looking at maximum $9000. It's a useless car, and will take me a while to sell the parts.",
1853,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"I'm sad to hear that. My rock bottom price is $11,000.  If you can see your way to make that great.",
1867,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,0,"Hey, I am interested in your radar detector.",
1868,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,1,"It really is a great one, you've found a good deal. Do you have any questions?",

1871,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,0,Any problems with it?,
1872,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,1,"No there's nothing wrong with it, I just wanted a newer one.",
1873,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,0,"Well, it looks great, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I was looking to pay maybe $210.",
1874,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,1,$220 and we've got a deal,
1875,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,0,That's a little bit more than I'd like to spend.,

1877,C_aa7f7c42fd9147d0a044f23a4ddf0557,0,"I see that the case and suction cups and included, so I will take it for $215.",

1936,C_b351311ceabe48c5b0c4f2514f3186a9,0,In that case I can only do $8.,

2008,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,0,"Yes, I see that. Is there any cosmetic damage to the car?",
2009,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,1,"There is a small accident on the side but you can hardly notice it. The miles are so low 48,135 and it drives wonderful.",
2010,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,0,"What was the accident? Is it a scratch, a dent?",
2011,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,1,A dent but I can fix it if you pay 8900.,
2012,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,0,Was there any other damage done to the car from the accident? Has it been in any other accidents? Did it needs anything replaced as a result?,

2014,C_95c3e1edd1614ed08839888d26019545,0,Have you changed the oil as recommended since you've owned it?,

2240,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Hello, are you looking to rent out my inlaw?",
2241,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,Yes. Would $900.00 be agreeable?,
2242,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"No, I'm afraid $900 would be far too low. This is in a very desirable area of Oakland, and it even comes with a shared on site laundry.",
2243,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,"Then, how about $1,000.00? I'm on a very strict budget, but I need something right away. I'm very quiet, I always pay on time and I have no pets.",
2244,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"That's closer, but I still think $1400 would be a more fair price. I forgot to mention another great benefit of this rental. Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)",
2245,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.,
2246,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",
2247,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,"If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.",
2248,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, I'll take that deal.",
2249,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,Agreed.,
2250,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, I look forward to practicing my poll dance moves to your music :)",
2251,C_ddbfc67459954abe91a5e74c1d9c60d8,0,Hello I am interested in this chair. I have a couple of questions first. Did you make this chair yourself?,
2252,C_ddbfc67459954abe91a5e74c1d9c60d8,1,"Yes I did, with the finest denim in all of the land",
2253,C_ddbfc67459954abe91a5e74c1d9c60d8,0,"Was it new denim, or were they someone's funky old worn out jeans?",
2254,C_ddbfc67459954abe91a5e74c1d9c60d8,1,Someone's LOVELY jeans.  Recycling helps mother earth!,
2255,C_ddbfc67459954abe91a5e74c1d9c60d8,0,Well I do like to help mother earth... do you have any matching pieces like end tables or night stands?,

3724,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,0,"Yes I am, just a few questions, is this a non smoking home?",
3725,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,1,"Yes, it is. I bought these brand new and have made sure to keep them in a smoke-free environment.",
3726,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,0,And how long did you have them?,
3727,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,1,I've had them for just a few years. I can assure you completely that they are in great condition.,
3728,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,0,"well The price is s lightly high for used couches, would you come down to $240 if I ALSO PICKED THEM UP?",
3729,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,1,I don't think I can go that low. I can give you both for $300 and I'll deliver them myself for no extra charge. Sound fair?,

3731,C_e9092991154545eab0da006e122f7c71,1,"Actually, that's fine. Again, I'll deliver them to you myself. Don't worry about picking them up.",
3732,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,Hello,

3735,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,"It looks good, but wondering a few things, how old is it?",
3736,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,"I bought it six months ago, but I never actually took it out of the original box.   It really has never been used.",
3737,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,"oh, why is that?",
3738,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,I expected to have more time.   I got sent on a 3 month business trip for my work and never got around it.,
3739,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,I just want to make sure they work and are quality/ not deffective,
3740,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,Thats fair.  You can examine it and test it in any way that you would like.  I have nothing to hide.,
3741,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,"That's ok, I was just making sure. Would you take $21?",
3742,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,"Thats kind of low because you know I am asking 35.   If you will go for 28, we have a deal.   Deal?",
3743,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,"What if I pick them up , coudl you then do 25?",
3744,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,1,"If you pick them up, I'll go down to 27.",
3745,C_4eaaf00fcf7d43cfa795a1defbd5bd48,0,okay sounds fair,
3931,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,0,"Hello, I am interested in your bike. Is the price negotiable?",
3932,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,1,Yes it is,
3933,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,0,"Great, Is the bike in good shape?",
3934,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,1,yes it is,
3935,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,0,Would you be willing to take $800?,
3936,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,1,I can give you $1000,
3937,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,0,How about $900?,
3938,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,1,$1000 is last,
3939,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,0,I suppose that would work.,
3940,C_0de2917096874db18f1374557ee37044,1,Great then,
3941,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Hi! I am willing to sell this bike at a great price are you interested?,
3942,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"Yes, I am very interested! It looks like a beautiful bike.",
3943,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Ok cool! The bike has very low miles and has and upgraded WTB saddle! It also has carbon blade forks and 105 brakes. I am willing to sell for as low as $750.,
3944,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,$750 seems a little steep since the bike already has some miles on it. Would you accept $400?,
3945,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,$595 is the lowest for a fact!,
3946,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"$595 is a little high for my budget. Are there any accessories you'd be willing to throw in--for instance, a basket, lights, and/or bike pump? That would make it a lot more appealing for me.",
3947,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,"I will throw in my 700c wheelset, instead of the standard wheelset. How about that!",
3948,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"I am excited for the 700c wheelset, but it looks like that was already listed in the ad. Is there anything else you can include?",
3949,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Nothing unfortunately. How about 550 and we can call it a night!,
3950,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"That sounds pretty reasonable. Before we make the final agreement, could you just let me know roughly how may miles are on the bike?",
3951,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Well I bought the bike from someone else and have not used it. He did not specify on the miles but just said that it was very low!,
3952,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"Hmm--the ad says that you bought it new. Since you actually bought it (lightly) used from someone else, can we lower the price to $450?",
3953,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Sounds good!,
3954,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,Hello.,
3955,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,"Hello, I have just viewed your advertisement for the white BMW Z3",

3957,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,"Yes, how many miles are on it?",
3958,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,15000,
3959,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,Have you done maintenance during the 15000 mile period?,
3960,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"yes, it is in great conditon.",
3961,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,That's great to hear! Do you have the maintenance records?,
3962,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"Yes , of curse, and I also have a warranty on it  for you , good for 5 more years.",
3963,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,A dealer warranty?,
3964,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,manufacturer.,
3965,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,Nice. What is the least that you would be willing to take on the car?,
3966,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"$4,200.00",
3967,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,That price is high for me right now. If I were to come view the car this weekend and offer $2000 cash would you be open to sell the car?,
3968,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,I am open to deals btu that is less than half of asking.. you need to come up some.,
3969,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,I could possibly do 2250 but that is a strain for me,
3970,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"I really do want to get rid of it, but I think that is just way to low for me.",
3971,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,It is a nice car and it would be going towards a good home. You could have it gone by this weekend and it would be off your hands. Would you take 2450?,
3972,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,I need at least 3200.,
3973,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,"I can pay you in cash, no hassle for you once you accept my offer",
3974,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,is yoru offer 3200 or higher?,
3975,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,I could possibly come up with $2750 by the weekend and we may be able to figure out what I can do for the difference,
3976,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"I just don't think we are going to agree here, too big a loss of me below 3200 even though I was wanting to get rid of it quickly.",
3977,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,0,What if you got to keep some of the parts? Such as the bumper bra; I really wouldn't need it and it probably cost you a good chunk of money,
3978,C_ff02a55751624199812bc4a6784fe018,1,"alright , I KEEP THOSE PARTS AND YOU GET IT FOR 3000",
4004,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,0,Hey so I'm interested in the bike you have for sale. Can you tell me about it?,
4005,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,"Sure thing. Frame is 17 Inches. Comes with a 3-speed Shimano nexus shifter. It works fine, but a tune-up and some new tires would help its performance greatly.",
4006,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,0,"Woah, that sounds like it needs a lot of stuff. What kind of condition is it in?",
4007,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,"Again, it's in great working condition. It doesn't need those things that I mentioned, but they would help.",
4008,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,0,So can you deliver it?,
4009,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,Sure. That won't be a problem. Will you be willing to pay the listed price for it?,
4010,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,0,"Absolutely not, I'm thinking more $40. It needs another $100 in work.",
4011,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,"That's a fair point, but $40 is too low for me. I'll go up to $65 for it, and won't charge extra for the delivery.",
4012,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,0,I'll meet you in the middle and pick it up at 52,
4013,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,That'll do fine.,

4532,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,How long have you had it?,
4533,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,"I had it for about a year but hardly used it, because my daughter outgrew very quickly, and it was for her actually.",

4538,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"Excellent! If you don't mind me asking, how much did you originally pay for it?",
4539,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I had originally got it for $200 but I am now selling it for half the price,
4540,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"I see.  I like the bike. It seems like a good deal, but I am very hesitant to pay $100 for it when it is a year old.  Is there any wiggle room on that price?",
4541,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I could bring it down to $90 that's about it because its not very old.,
4542,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"$90 pretty good, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80.  Maybe we can meet in the middle at $85?",
4543,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I can do $90 and that's about it,

4729,C_c29c8c3f79e9470f96e9498e03e83647,0,I was hoping for more like $160.,
4730,C_c29c8c3f79e9470f96e9498e03e83647,1,It is in almost new condition. It is in great shape. How about if I deliver it to you?,
4731,C_c29c8c3f79e9470f96e9498e03e83647,0,"I could do 220, tops.",
4732,C_c29c8c3f79e9470f96e9498e03e83647,1,How about we meet in the middle? 240?,
4733,C_c29c8c3f79e9470f96e9498e03e83647,0,alright 240,

4758,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,"There is a manual and there is iTunes leftover credit for $12, so you can buy some music with that.",

4761,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I could offer $230.00,
4762,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,I would sell for $300.,
4763,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,$250?,

4765,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I could do $255 with the headphones.,

4788,C_10be3e9e41834ee184d68cdd2adf3e1a,0,How long are they?,
4789,C_10be3e9e41834ee184d68cdd2adf3e1a,1,They are long but not wide. They rest comfortably on the back of a standard workbench comfortably. They take up the whole length of the bench.,
4790,C_10be3e9e41834ee184d68cdd2adf3e1a,0,"Okay well, I could use a pair of these for setting different plastics, I would like to pay $54",

4795,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Hey that seems to be a nice bike,
4796,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,It is a very nice bike. Can I answer any questions you may have?,
4797,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well any issue with the bike missing pedals or parts and pieces?,
4798,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,All the parts and pedals are in good working condition. This bike has hardly been rode.,
4799,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,I see well lets get into it then now the bike is 3 years so I was thinking your current price is a bit too steep,
4800,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I would be willing to knock $200 of the price.,
4801,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well I was thinking of offering $1320,
4802,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I don't think I could go that low. I could do $1750 if you came and picked up the bike.,
4803,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well do you have anything you could throw in to make the 17500 a little more encouraging you have to consider the age and also its lack of use there could be parts that are seezing or rusty. Actually what is the condition of the tires and chain,
4804,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I have been riding bikes for several years and I keep this bike in good working order. Since this bike has been upgraded quite a bit I think that would be worth the price since it would keep you from having to upgrade it yourself.,
4805,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,ok can I get you to come down to 1600,
4806,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I could do that.,
4807,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Thanks I'd appreciate that.,

4845,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,0,Okay cool. Has it been in any accidents?,
4846,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,1,No. I'm a very safe driver. Does $4500 sound good to you?,
4847,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,0,I could do $3300,
4848,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,1,That's a bit low for me. I need a little more to put towards the ring I'm buying my fiance. I could part with it for $3900,
4849,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,0,How about $3500?,
4850,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,1,Okay. It's a deal,

4880,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,I have a little wiggle room.,

4883,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"Hm.  Well, remember that this is a 1 bedroom 1 bath in a fantastic area.",
4884,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,I understand that. This is the one place where I have been lookin for an apartment to become available.,
4885,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,It's also been renovated.  It has a great parking space that comes with the apartment.,
4886,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,Would you take $2000? It is only a little less than what you are asking.,
4887,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"What about $2100?  I think that's fair.  This does include a lot of luxuries, including community laundry rooms, heated pools, hot tubs, saunas, and a fitness center.",

4889,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,"Oh, I wasn't made aware of those amenities!!! If I fixed things up that need repairs would you take the $2000?",
4890,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"That's still a little low.  Actually, the place has granite counter tops and gorgeous flooring in there already.  I'm still looking for $2100.",
4891,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,It is definitely over my original budget of under $1500 that I was looking for. I may need to keep looking even though this place is great.,
4892,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,I tell you what...let me see if we can do $2050.  What do you think?,
4893,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,I think I could do the extra $50. That seems fair.,
4894,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,Deal!,
4895,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,Thank you for being considerate.,
5046,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,So interested in this apartment?,
5047,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,"Yes, but the list price is higher than I was planning to pay.",
5048,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,I see what were you hoping for,
5049,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,"I really was hoping for $1500, but I don't know if that is actually realistic.",
5050,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,That would be too sharp of a drop unfortunately please understand this is a premium apartment i could manage 2500,
5051,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,I could do $2000.,
5052,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,going that low would significantly affect your security deposit amount but it is possible,
5053,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,What are you looking for in terms of a security deposit?,
5054,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,well on average with good credit we get 387 however lowering the rent that much may push you into a thousand,
5055,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,"I could go as high as $1200 on the security deposit, if the rent is $2000.",
5056,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,Well that sounds like we might have a deal,
5057,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,Ok. Good,
5080,C_0ffcdaf4686e42f291c671955ba89991,1,"Hello, looking for a bike",

5094,C_0ffcdaf4686e42f291c671955ba89991,1,go ahead and put your offer in for $700,
5095,C_0ffcdaf4686e42f291c671955ba89991,0,Tank you,
5096,C_0ffcdaf4686e42f291c671955ba89991,1,"Sure, no problem.",
5171,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"Hi, what can I tell you about this bike? It's really cool and is vintage!",
5172,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,"Yes, I can see that!  Are all the parts original Schwinn?",
5173,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,Yes they are! They're in great condition too.,
5174,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,No rust?,
5175,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,No rust at all. It rides really smoothly and I've never had a problem with rusting in the 10 years I've owned the cruiser,
5176,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,What about the chain.  Has it ever been replaced or is it the original chain,
5177,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"No, it's the original!",
5178,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,I'm asking because we don't have a Schwinn store in the area and I hate to order parts online.,
5179,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"The original makes it more vintage and classic, to be honest. Also, apologies-- I actually forgot to tell you the tires are new and they're Kendra, not Schwinn. But you'd want new tires anyways since new tires are what keep the cruiser riding smoothly. You wouldn't want tires from the 60s.",
5180,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,"Lol It was a good time, but yeah, you're right.  Ok, so what's the rock bottom price you would accept for this beauty?",
5181,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,I'd be willing to sell for $200.,
5182,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,Ouch!!  My budget is very tight and I want this bike soooooooo bad.  Would you be willing to accept 190?,
5183,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,Sure. $190 is fine.,
5184,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,Great!,
5217,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Hi, can you tell me more about the condition of the iPhones?",
5218,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"Both are like new.  My parents who are retired used them for about 6-7, with less than 10 hours of talk time.",
5219,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"What does it mean they used them ""for about 6-7""?",
5220,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"oops!  sorry, it's late and I'm trying hard to get these phones sold.  I meant to say they used them for about 6-7 months.",
5221,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Ok. Well, I think that those phones probably got a good amount of use in 6-7 months. So, would you be willing to accept a price of $75?",
5222,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone.",
5223,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",
5224,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,I think we can do that since you're local.  190 for both phones and I will deliver.  How's tomorrow afternoon?,
5225,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,sounds good,
5226,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,Great!  I hope you enjoy your new phones.,
5273,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"Hi, I am interested but have afew questions...",
5274,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,sure :),
5275,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,is the reserved parking spot covered?,
5276,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,yes it is covered by a carport. We also have garages avaliable for an additional fee. The garages are not attached to the apartment itself but they are within the building and have an entryway so you won't have to walk outside in the elements to get to your garage.,
5277,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"I just wanted a covered spot, though the garage sounds nice , I am on a budget. I was also curious as to your pet policy..?",
5278,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,pets are allowed with a $100 deposit for dogs over 40lbs and $50 for cats and small dogs.,
5279,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"I see. well like I said I am interested but on a budget any chance I can get it at a discount, say $1712",
5280,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,"I cannot go that low, the lowest I can go is 2100. Did I mention utilities (water, gas, sewer, electricity) are included? We also have all brand new appliances in the our units as well as new flooring throughout.",
5281,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"It all sounds so lovely, anyway you can waive the pet fee if I do it at 2100?",
5282,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,I can't waive the deposit but I can spread the deposit out over 1 year making rent $2108.34/month for the first year.,
5283,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,I only have one cat.. no way you can do 2100?,
5284,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,1,oh I realize I didn't even ask what type of animal. I have to keep a deposit in case your cat messes up the apartment. 2101 (making it a $12 deposit spread out over the year),
5285,C_5d13fb99d8f5489d82ddce478dccb3e2,0,"alright, fair enough",
5325,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,Hi. What wattage does this coffee maker have?,
5326,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,Hello. This is a premium 250W Gevalia coffee maker,
5327,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,Good. Thanks for that info.  Can it make 2 cups of coffee at the same time?,
5328,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,Yes it can,
5329,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,Great. I'm interested. How about $12,
5330,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,12 is a little low for me. I bought it for 55 so I was hoping for at least 25.,
5331,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,25 is a bit more than I wanted to spend. Is this used or new?,
5332,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,This is new. I just happened to get two coffee makers for my birthday so i'm getting rid of this one cheap.,
5333,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,Oh Okay. How about $18?,
5334,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,1,I think I can do 18,
5335,C_20e689e3101341068b0f7c231b193dd4,0,That's awesome. Can I swing by and pick it up today?,
5404,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,"Hello, I am interested in you iPad mini. Is it still available?",
5405,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"Yes, it is!",
5406,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,"Great, is the price negotiable?",
5407,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"Somewhat, but this is in amazing condition and it includes the case.",
5408,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,I actually have a case so I don't need or want the case. You can keep it and sell it separately.,
5409,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"Okay, without the case I would be asking $165.",
5410,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,This is a first gen model and only has 32GB. I would like to pay $75.,
5411,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,There is no way I can do that. I would be happy to take $150.,
5412,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,I just don't see that it is worth that. How about $100.,
5413,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"I would be willing to meet you in the middle, but I cannot take a penny under $125.",
5414,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,I suppose I could do that if you are willing to deliver the iPad.,
5415,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"okay, I can do that.",
5452,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,Hello,
5453,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,"Hello, what can you tell me about this item?",
5454,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,I'm selling a GoPro Hero 3 black edition with a waterproof case. It has an 8g memory stick and the charging cable. It is in excellent condition and works perfectly!,
5455,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,Does it come with the original box?,
5456,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,Sure does! I didn't really use it much. I've only had it for a few months.,
5457,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,What are you asking for it?,
5458,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,"Well, they retail for around $379. It is slightly used so I'm asking for $130",
5459,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,Will you deliver it?,
5460,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,Yes. The $130 includes shipping!,
5461,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,I will pay you 98 for it and I will come pick it up.  Since it doesn't come with a warranty I dont want to risk paying to much.,
5462,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,"Hmm, 98 is a bit too low for me. I'm looking to get back some of my money here. The item is basically brand new. How about $120?",
5463,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,will you throw in a warranty with it?,
5464,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,It's still under warranty. I've only had it for 3 months and I believe the warranty is good for 2 years.,
5465,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,Ok deal,
5520,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,"Hello, is this house still for sale?",
5521,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,"Yes, it is still available for leasing. Would you like to come take a tour?",
5522,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,I would love to.  Can you tell me a little about it?,
5523,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,It is a 3 Bedroom 1 bath home. In great neighborhood. It's professionally maintained. It is a must see house.,
5524,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,What are you asking for the house?,
5525,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,Rent is $1595 a month. Utilities are not included.,
5526,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,Are you able to go any lower?  The comps around the neighboorhood are cheaper than this price.,
5527,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,"We can offer you a discount of $100/mo if you can sign 1 year lease, providing that your application is approved.",
5528,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,Would you be willing to accept 1395 if I signed a 2 year lease?,
5529,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,"Sorry, right now we can only offer the $100 discount. Remember we do the maintenance, including landscapes. That alone adds value to your lease.",
5530,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,"Ok, well I think 1395 is a fair deal if you will be able to pay for half the utilities.  That is my last offer, take it or leave it.",
5560,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,"Hello, are you here about the listing?",
5561,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,"Hello, yes, I am.",
5562,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,"I'm sure you already saw in the ad, but the bars are $30, and are unused. Did you have any questions?",
5563,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,I do. Is the original boxes and paperwork with them? Is there a warranty with the parts that will be transferred to me if I purchase them?,
5564,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,"Everything that came in the box with them is there, I put it all back in after I realized I wouldn't be able to use them on my bike. Unfortunately the warranty for them is outdated by now, they're in new condition, but they've been sitting for a while.",
5565,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,"I am interested in them. However, since the warranty is outdated now, would you be willing to come down on the price?",
5566,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,"I am willing to negotiate the price a little lower, that isn't a problem.",
5567,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,"If I agree to pick them up, would you be willing to do $22 considering there is no warranty and they have been sitting for awhile.",
5568,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,"$22 is a little bit low for me, but I could definitely come down in price if you do pick them up. How about we meet halfway at $25?",
5569,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,"Well, it is a bit of a drive for me. I'm sure you want to get rid of these, could you do $23?",
5570,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,1,I suppose that would be about the price it'd cost to ship them out. You've got yourself a deal bud.,
5571,C_56e7f9b6cd69421baa80a20113f43a45,0,Thank you.,
5671,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,Hey there! I'm interested in buying your 3DS. Is there any noticeable wear and tear?,
5672,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,Nope,
5673,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,Are there any games stored on the internal memory card?,
5674,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,no only the three games being sold with it. This a timeless console and i promise you its worth the price,
5675,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,"When you say timeless, do you mean that it cannot tell me the time?",
5676,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,no i mean it will last you a long time and still be fun,
5677,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,"Ah, I see. If I were to pick it up from you, would you come down to $86?",
5678,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,No the 110 doesn't include delivery. Common though do you know how much you would pay for a brand new one without 3 games,
5679,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,"This one isn't brand new, so I don't see the relevance.",
5680,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,no it isn't but its a fully functional one with 3 games so i would say ts certainly worth 110 dollars,
5681,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,0,Hmm. I'd be in at $95.,
5682,C_41895c06fdff4974ae344282660fcff4,1,Im sorry i cant.  Accept that,
5683,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,"Hello, I am interested in the cabinets you have listed.",
5684,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Hi, the cabinets are brand new and unopened - they're great, but just don't fit in my kitchen.",
5685,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,How long have you had them?,
5686,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"I bought them about 3 months ago, and still have the receipts.",
5687,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,Okay. Do you know if Home Depot can still special order these cabinets?,
5688,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Yes, they still carry the line so you should still be able to order them.",
5689,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,"Okay, great! I am actually looking for four of them. Does this come with the hardware for them as well?",
5690,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"I have the hardware I purchased for them that I would be willing to throw in, I just need the space and to get these out of here!",
5691,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,"Okay, I am very interested in the cabinets. You are a little bit of a drive for me, would you be willing to negotiate on the price a bit?",
5692,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"If you are within 20 miles of Oakland, I will deliver at no cost.",
5693,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,"I'm actually not, I am about 42 miles one way.",
5694,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Okay, I could go down to $70 - they are already quite discounted, and I will include the hardware.",
5695,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,Would you be willing to do $65,
5696,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Not with the hardware included, $70 is as low as I can go.",
5697,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,Could you do the $65 without the hardware?,
5698,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Yes, that's fine.",
5699,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,"Okay, you got yourself a deal.",
5874,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"Hi, you inquired about the IPAD I have advertised? What questions can I answer for you?",
5875,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,How old is it?,
5876,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"Great question. It is only a year old. I decided to get the next generation. I love to get new gadgets as soon as they come out so every year, I upgrade",
5877,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,It's really still in excellent condition?  No scratches or dead pixels? Nothing chipped. No scuffs? Everything functions 100%?,
5878,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"It is in excellent condition. I usually use my Mac Pro book to do all my work on. The Ipad is just for reading in bed at night until I fall asleep. I have all the original accessories that came with it, plus I have all the latest apps.",
5879,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,Last questions:  How long does the battery last when fully charged?,
5880,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"Now that is why this baby is the bomb. It can go six days or more. I have a battery saver app downloaded, that makes power consumption very low. I have gone over two weeks without charging it but I make sure to charge it once a week so the batteries will last",
5881,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,Sounds good.  The only issue I have is that the image on the add is broken.  So I would be forced to take your word 100% on the condition and accuracy of the item.  Will you sell it to me for $150?,
5882,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"I can assure you that you will not have to take my word for anything. Since we are in the same city I will deliver the product or we can meet up in a public place and you can see it for yourself. I am letting it go for way more than it is worth at $175. Even a refurbished one, which has damage would run you $250 or more in the store. This one is in pristine condition, plus I have over $1000 of software that I purchased on there.",
5883,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,Fair enough.,
5884,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,Great doing business with you. Enjoy your IPAD,

6048,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"well, I wasn't looking for something quite that high, could it be closer to 1700?",
6049,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,1800 is final but look at it this way. I will pay for the water. so no water bill for you. this is a lot of savings for you,
6050,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"true, its good not to have that bill,but I wasnt looking to spend that much a month, is there no way to lower the monthly a little?",

6076,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,Hello how can I help you?,
6077,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,I'm interested in purchasing the sub box.,
6078,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,Sure!,
6079,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,What's the best price you can give me for it?,
6080,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,I am taking it out for $50. I can give it to you for $45. This costed me more than what I expected to be made. They're custom molded around the latch and the inside of the tailgate. The box is going to fit in most vehicles universally.,
6081,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,How about $20?,
6082,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,That's too low. The last I can do is $40,
6083,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,$25?,
6084,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,I can do $40 last,
6085,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,$30?,
6086,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,$40 is last,
6087,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,I'll have to think about it some more then.,
6088,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,"Tell you what, I can give it to you for $35 but then you will have to come pick it up! I wouldn't be able to deliver it ti you.",
6089,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,Sure that's fine.,
6101,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,Hello! I am very much interested in purchasing this bike. Do you have it only in blue color?,
6102,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,"Yes, I only have to one bike and it is blue. It was recently painted so there are no defects in the paint",
6103,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",
6104,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.,
6105,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,
6106,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.,
6107,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,
6108,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.,
6109,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,I cannot go beyond $150.,
6110,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties.",
6111,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,How about $180 and I can come get it from you right away?,
6112,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,Ok. for $180 that would work.,
6149,C_41c00b1b01fd4570a2435c2f2cd23e6f,1,hello. oscilloscope for sale here.,
6150,C_41c00b1b01fd4570a2435c2f2cd23e6f,0,Hi would you take 320?,

6153,C_41c00b1b01fd4570a2435c2f2cd23e6f,1,that's just 10 bucks above your last offer. no.,

6157,C_41c00b1b01fd4570a2435c2f2cd23e6f,1,ah fair enough. maybe look elsewhere. good luck,
6158,C_41c00b1b01fd4570a2435c2f2cd23e6f,0,ok good selling it for that price,
6170,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,"Hi, you're interested in the Cx-9?",
6171,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,"Yes, I am. Has it been in any accidents?",
6172,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,"It's been in a couple minor accidents, but I can assure you that it only resulted in cosmetic damage. I still have the recipts from the body shop to show what was replaced.",
6173,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,"Well the interior looks nice from the picture but what color is it? Also, did you smoke in it?",
6174,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,It's a light silver color. Smoke has never entered this beauty.,
6175,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,"I agree, it is a beauty but it does have a lot of miles and is over 10 years old so $8800 is too much for me. How would you feel about $6500?",
6176,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,"I have another buyer willing to pay $7000 at the moment. If you could beat that price, we may have a deal.",
6177,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,I'm going to pull a price is right move. Would you take $7001 in cash today?,
6178,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,"I was hoping to at least hit the $7500 mark, but that move was witty enough for me to agree to it! You made my day, honestly.",
6179,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,Awesome. It's a deal.,
6196,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,Hello.,
6197,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,Hello to you friend,
6198,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Yes, I'm interested in this dresser from your ad?",
6199,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"Well its a great set, the night stand is included with the price. Now I do need this picked up by Sat. will that work for you?",
6200,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Well, the ad says it's missing a handle, is there anything else wrong with it?",
6201,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"It's true the handle is unattached, but as it also states the handle is with the dresser. There are a small number of beauty marks from regular use, but other the the handle, no noticeable damage.",
6202,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Well, I'm interested, but considering the need to repair the handle, I'd like to pay $75.",
6203,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"That is less than I paid for the night stand alone, that is unacceptable. If the handle is a concern, I can however lower the total price to 175.",
6204,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Well, I'd be willing to come pick it up, but I really couldn't go more than $110.",
6205,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"150 is my lowest price, or I can find another buyer",
6206,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Well, okay, 150 it is.",
6207,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,agreed,

6291,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,1,It is actually in great condition.,
6292,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,0,Okay but are there any signs of wear and tear? Scratches? stuff like that,
6293,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,1,There is only one small scratch on the back of it near the bottom.,
6294,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,0,Okay since it's used can you negotiate the price a little?,
6295,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,1,I could negotiate a little bit. How much are you thinking?,
6296,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,0,Could you go to 30?,
6297,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,1,How about 35?,
6298,C_450e208732a44866856ea56ccb51f796,0,Okay 35 sounds fair to me :),

6362,C_932458353b8f47038c49c41b05e5a7b6,1,The kitchen comes with stove and fridge and it's really large. Garbage and water are included! It's super sunny in there and has a large closet. Bonus!,

6366,C_932458353b8f47038c49c41b05e5a7b6,1,What is your first offer and we'll go from there.,
6367,C_932458353b8f47038c49c41b05e5a7b6,0,I think I would like to be able to start at 1500,
6368,C_932458353b8f47038c49c41b05e5a7b6,1,Guess what? It's your lucky day. That's the lowest I am offered to go. Would you like to move in at 1500 a month? It is a one year lease term. Is that possible for you?,

6618,C_a69f97231ee64eab951bb4280be094bb,1,that's not really the direction you should be going. i've listed it for 150 which is already a steal.,

6641,C_5f01b4a3fb3b40b9832799c1ae80a3e1,0,Hmm... Why would an iPhone show an Android logo?,
6642,C_5f01b4a3fb3b40b9832799c1ae80a3e1,1,Sry..I miss typed that. If it shows the android logo it is not genuine.  Mine are.  I can send you a link to check it out for yourself.,

6682,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,"I put a lot of extras into this bike and it is in great condition. I can go down a little bit, but not too much. I am asking 250, but I can probably do 225",

6748,C_8b7d23c0f5944ff0a3280ed0da303399,1,That seems a bit low. How about 400? That seems like a fair price. It is in excellent condition.,
6749,C_8b7d23c0f5944ff0a3280ed0da303399,0,"true, but it's not the newest model...how about 300...that half of the original..seems fair for used yeh?",

6758,C_34f2c7ecff19413daf3ae97ed229f872,0,Are you willing to come down on the price at all?  What is you best price?,
6759,C_34f2c7ecff19413daf3ae97ed229f872,1,"My best price is firm at $650.  The product is brand new, still in the box, and is the most popular variant.",

6789,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Would you be able to come down in cost?,
6790,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,Potentially.  I've always hated this carpet my wife chose to put in.  I'd come down a bit just to say that it was because of the carpeting.,
6791,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Ok.  I would be a great tenant.  I could offer $2000.,
6792,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,I can't go nearly that low.  This property is the upper echelon of homes in this area.  I could accept $3700 though.,
6793,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Any extra perks you can throw in?  Like paid utilities? Furniture?,
6794,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,"I can't offer to pay your utilities because there's no telling what that cost will be.  However, the home could easily be equipped with solar panels.  Also, it's equipped with a complete set of furnishings and appliances, though I expect you will want to bring at least some of your own.",
6795,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Ok.  I can move in as soon as you are ready if you can bring the payment to $3500.,
6796,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,$3600 and you've got a deal.,
6797,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,deal,
6995,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"Hello, interest in my bike?",
6996,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,Hey hows it going i have interest,
6997,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,I'm asking $250 but the price is negotiable,
6998,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,OK Thats good to hear. I really like the bike but i think $250 would have been a fair price about 5 years ago :/,
6999,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"Lol  hey!  vintage is in!!  Ok, since you're being a good sport how does 200 sound?",
7000,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,"its a little bit out of my price range still, I really need the bike to get to my new job. I have $125 to spare but i can walk to pick it up from you if that helps?? We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up",
7001,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150",
7002,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :),
7003,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!",
7004,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,"Ahh make me one more compromise, i know im the worst. i can scrounge an extra 15 up, how about 140?",
7005,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,ok you drive a hard bargain.  please remember to pay it forward.  $140 - sold to the whinney person over there!  lol,
7006,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,"You are the best :) Thank you this is super helpful for me, see you soon!",
7007,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,You're interested in the furniture?,
7008,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,YES I AM. VERY!,
7009,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,Are you able to pick it up or do you need it delivered?,
7010,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,I could definitely get my husband to pick it up as soon as possible if we could work out a deal.,
7011,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,Ok so what were you thinking in the terms of price? Everything is as pictured and in great shape they're just too big,
7012,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,"I understand. You did say that you have had them for a few years. It is also only one couch, which i could probably buy brand new for the same price. I was thinking $200.00",
7013,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,Actually it's a couch love seat and two ottomans,
7014,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Well you have only listed 1 couch with the sizes so i assumed it was only 1,
7015,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,"Odd.. Couch is 80x40, love seat is 60x40 and the 2 ottomans are 22x22",
7016,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Would you be willing to go $240.00 since i can pick it up today,
7017,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,Nah I was originally looking to get $650.00 for the set I can come down to maybe $50 but not lower. It's a whole living room set,
7018,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Well the item is listed at $500.00 which means you are willing to go down lower. So lets say $350.00. This is a few years old so i'm sure it has wear and tear problem areas.,
7019,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,1,I can do $400 and throw in all the throw pillows and area rug that  you can see in the picture too,
7020,C_3c750b075f5e40f798b1749b57097729,0,Deal,
7031,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,"Hi, can you tell me a little more about this house?",
7032,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,1,Hello,
7033,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,1,It is a beautiful house,
7034,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,What are some of the perks?,
7035,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,1,"Great green lawn, garage",
7036,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,Does it have a swimming pool?  My family and I are new to the area and would like to lease for at least 6 mos. maybe more but the kids really would like a pool.  How much wiggle room in the price?,
7037,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,1,"$3,100.00",
7038,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,That's a little steep.  Would you accept 2975?,
7039,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,1,3000,
7040,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,Are utilities included?,

7042,C_80756847c2ed4d09994db9deb38c85d5,0,"ok, I'll take it for 3000",
7043,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,Hello,
7044,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,Hello! So you're looking for an apartment?,
7045,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,No the house,
7046,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,"I'm sorry, that's what I meant. I have a great single family house for rent that I think would be perfect for you.",
7047,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,But you don't know me,
7048,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,This house is perfect for everyone.,
7049,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"You mean anyone. Anyways, don't worry I'm interested.",
7050,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,What price were you looking to pay?,
7051,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Free, I'm only kidding honey. Listen, I'm wondering if this community is diverse. I'm a single gay father, and I just divorced my wife. Are you still sure this place is perfect for anyone?",
7052,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,"Yes sir, this is a nice house for rent in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are two large master bedrooms and two other single bedrooms with a total of three bathrooms. The house is great for a small family.",
7053,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Right, but I'm not really in a family anymore. I will have my daughter occasionally, is it near schools?",
7054,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,It's easily walkable to schools.,
7055,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Oh that's nice. I work from home, I'm making a new business so I was thinking it could double as a place to work out of. I don't think with the divorce I will be able to pay what you want.",
7056,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,"The house is listed at $3500 per month, but there's a special going on right now for $2900 per month. I take it that's a bit out of your price range?",
7057,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Honey, everything is out of my price range. My wife is Christian. My daughter is 14 and not into having a gay father. Anyways, this house has what I need to be a responsible father in contemporary society. Maybe we could do a 6 month lease at one price and then negotiate further. I have immaculate credit.",
7058,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,Sounds great. Make an offer.,
7059,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Right now, I now I could give you 2000 per month easy...",
7060,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,That works well.,
7061,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,Great!,
7179,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,"Hi, I saw the bungalow you have posted. Is it still available?",
7180,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,1,"Yes it is, It really is a great location. I recently landscaped the yard to make this an oasis.",
7181,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,What is the square footage? It looks rather small...,
7182,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,1,"It is a 1000 square foot two bedroom home with an updated kitchen, and living room. The kitchen has a great backsplash and new granite",
7183,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,"Well, it is small, but since it's only me, I think it will work. I think the rent is too high for the size of the house. Will  you consider $1500? I can pay 3 months in advance.",
7184,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,1,"Are you saying $1,500 per month?",
7185,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,"Yes, I checked the comps in the area and it's about the going price for the size of the house.",
7186,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,1,"I really can not go that low, I would be willing to include water service and change the air filters every month for $2,000 per month.",
7187,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,"How about $1800. I can sign 1 year lease. It will be just me, no kids or pet. I am very clean :)",
7188,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,1,I can do that but at that price I can not do the water or filters.,
7189,C_7d66d2a4b63d475e8846c4add7a39de0,0,That's fair.,
7190,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,1,Hello,
7191,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,0,I'm somewhat interested in your product. Can you give me some more information on it?,
7192,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,1,It is an IPhone 7 brand new,
7193,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,0,Would you be able to meet so I can make sure it's in good working order?,
7194,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,1,Absolutely! I  can still see the features of it.,
7195,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,0,"Great, is your price negotiable?",
7196,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,1,Originally it lists for $600. I am open to offers,
7197,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,0,Im looking to spend around $300.00.,
7198,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,1,That is low for a brand new IPhone 7. I can't go that low. I can accept $500.00.,
7199,C_80f7a289c98c4131863cede7a9b3fa28,0,"That sounds fair, I can do $500.00 as long as we meet before and test out the phone.",

7227,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,"I was thinking $25 for it, what do you say?",
7228,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,I can't it go for less than $30,
7229,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,"I'm low on money, can you do $28?",
7230,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,"Sorry, I can't. It was $55 new",
7231,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,What if In pick it up? And pay $29?,
7232,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,That would work!,
7233,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,Awesome! let me submit my offer! Thanks!,

7280,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Hello,
7281,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,Hello,
7282,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Did you have any questions about the lamp?,
7283,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"Yes, how much did you pay for the lamp?",
7284,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,I spent $250 for it and it is absolutely worth the price but i just doesn't work with the design in my living room so I'm offering it for only $200.,
7285,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,I would love to buy the lamp but the most I would be willing to budge would be $140.,
7286,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Hmmm that is quite a low offer. It is only a week old and you'd be paying a lot more than that to buy it new.,
7287,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"Yes, but the item is simply not new and has faced depreciation.",
7288,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,"Not really, and not nearly as much as you are suggesting. But I'll tell you what, if you can make the $200 I will throw in a Serge Mouille sconce, not reproduction but original Serge Mouille, it matches his lamp perfectly of course, I'll throw that in for the full $200 if you can pick them up right away.",
7289,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"I would not be interested in that item, only floor lamp itself. What is your best counter offer on the lamp?",
7290,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,I'm going to hold firm on the $200 since you're not being at all reasonable and made such a lowball offer.,
7301,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Hi how are you?,
7302,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,"Hello, I'm interested in buying the truck. I have a couple questions. I'm good thank-you and you?",
7303,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Vey well. How can i help you?,
7304,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,Do you have the title to the truck? Are there other rips on the seats? When was the last time it had a tune up?,
7305,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Yes i have the title! Not only are there no rips on the seats they are heated as well. The entire interior is beautiful and it was barely driven it only has 68000 miles on it.,
7306,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,Super now is it at all possible to lower the price? It's something I'd like it's just out of my budget.,
7307,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,I would be willing to go to 6000 but no lower. Are you willing to accept that?,
7308,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,"I was thinking more around 4,000.",
7309,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,No for a truck in this condition with this many miles on it it is worth far more than that i will drop to 5800 but no lower.,
7310,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,"Wow, you're sure solid. Is there any way you could go 5500?",
7311,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Sure,
7502,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,Is this for sale or rent?,
7503,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,It is for rent.,
7504,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,how many bedrooms are available,
7505,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,This unit is a 3 bedroom.,
7506,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,Are any utilities included?,
7507,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,Utilities are not included in the rent price.,
7508,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,"I would need a lower rent price so that I can pay for utlities, $1000",
7509,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,1000 is far too low. We can bring the price down to 2300 if you have good employment.,
7510,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,"you barely moved on price, how about $1200",
7511,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,"You started from too low of a price, this is a platinum upgraded apartment with premium features. You can't just ask any low ball price and expect a deal.",
7512,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,"Platinum is in quotes in the listing, I'm not so sure of the legitimacy of this apartment",
7513,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,It is easily verified online and also in person at the office. Are you actually interested in the apartment?,
7514,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,0,"I would have to see it in person, does the complex have a pool or gym?",
7515,C_e2cb742bae1a41bf97e5ebebeb9e33f8,1,Yes we have a great pool and also a full gym on site.,

9897,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,1,"I cant lower the price because it is leased through hayward toyota and this is the balance that needs to be paid off.

10053,C_70eb9727990841d2bf293610b4b50b4f,1,1800... that will require a 4 year lease. and every year the home will have to be inspected and you will have to pay for any repairs or cleaning that's needed.,

10689,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,1,Well I have one how perfect.  It is a beautiful property and better than an apartment because you are going to get your own garage and backyard.  There is also a community pool and clubhouse in the gated community.  We are only asking 1800 a month with an equal deposit,
10690,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,0,Wow.  Sounds great but my budget was under $1000 a month.,

10695,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,1,Well if you would be willing to sign a 2 year lease I could come down as low as 1400 a month and with your great credit I will also be able to waive the security deposit.,
10696,C_3ab915e23d874005b65bdbe2b4cfca67,0,"I would appreciate the security deposit being waived.  Why don't we meet in the middle, anyway $1,300?",

13621,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,1,Unfortunately that's very low for this much space and this neighborhood. The typical rent in this particular area for a similar property is about 3400,
13622,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,0,Finances are very tight right now. The most I can do would probably be $2500,

13809,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Hi there are you interested?,
13810,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Hi. I am really interested in your furniture. Do you have any pets or children?,
13811,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,No I do not have any pets or children,
13812,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Do you mind telling me how many stains are on the furniture and where?,
13813,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Sure. The stain is very light and it was caused when we tried to move in the furniture to the patio. Its very light and not seen at all. I mentioned it to make sure that when I sell the buyer has the knowledge of it.,
13814,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,How old is the furniture? 550 seems awful high. I saw something at goodwill for less than half of that price that was similar.,
13815,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,"Well the furniture is as new and its a branded one too and I am selling it for half the price of what I had got it for. So 550 is reasonable, but I am willing to negotiate. Give me a price!",
13816,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,I was hoping you would be willing to go 250?,
13817,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Wow that's way too low. That's half of what I am selling it off for. I can give it to you for $400,
13818,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,"Maybe 300? Money is awful tight and we just had a house fire, lost everything. And with the baby on the way, I just can't go much higher.",
13819,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,$380 is the last price I can help you with. I need to get my money to get my wife a new couch too so its just fair.,
13820,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,Okay. I think I may have to keep looking unless you will accept 350.,
13821,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Well I can give it to you for 350 its not like 30 dollars is gonna take me anywhere :) Deal!,

13836,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,That's great news!  What's the lowest that you are willing to go?,
13837,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"Well, since I put in my ad that the price is firm and I'm not interested in having my time wasted with lowball offers but that is the first thing you came out with out of the gate, it is a bit disconcerting that you haven't even asked any questions about the car, just two attempts to lowball me. I tried to be polite the first time but you don't seem to be very reasonable...",
13838,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,I didn't mean to offend you. I was just seeing if you had a range in mind. Any reason why you are downsizing this project in particular?,
13839,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"I've simply already spent as much time on it, and put as many upgrades on it as I am interested in.  I already have another just like it.",

13843,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,Yeah I have a guy coming to look at it in a few minutes.,
13844,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,"Ok. Well, my budget is around $9,500 and the listed price is out of my range. The car looks great, however if you're set on the $13,500 price, I won't be able to afford it.",
13845,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,Alright well you haven't given me any reason to lower my price even though I went against my ad and said that I would be willing to negotiate right out of the gate. Thanks for your interest though.,

18314,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,Sure. The stain is very light and it was caused when we tried to move in the furniture to the patio. Its very light and not seen at all. I mentioned it to make sure that when I sell the buyer has the knowledge of it.,
18315,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,0,How old is the furniture? 550 seems awful high. I saw something at goodwill for less than half of that price that was similar.,

18320,C_a66e264eece042d4859c93ce1fa851d8,1,$380 is the last price I can help you with. I need to get my money to get my wife a new couch too so its just fair.,

18342,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,Hello! I am interested in buying the Chevelle Malibu SS Convertible.,
18343,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"Hello! Great, do you have any questions ?",
18344,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,Yes. The price listed is a bit out of my range. I was wondering if you are willing to sell for a lower price?,
18345,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"Sure, we can definitely try to negotiate the price. But the car runs great and has a lot of upgrades.",
18346,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,That's great news! What's the lowest that you are willing to go?,
18347,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"Well, since I put in my ad that the price is firm and I'm not interested in having my time wasted with lowball offers but that is the first thing you came out with out of the gate, it is a bit disconcerting that you haven't even asked any questions about the car, just two attempts to lowball me. I tried to be polite the first time but you don't seem to be very reasonable...",
18348,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,I didn't mean to offend you. I was just seeing if you had a range in mind. Any reason why you are downsizing this project in particular?,
18349,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,"I've simply already spent as much time on it, and put as many upgrades on it as I am interested in. I already have another just like it.",
18350,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,How many miles does it have on it?,
18351,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,Just 15k,
18352,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,Have you had any other offers?,
18353,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,Yeah I have a guy coming to look at it in a few minutes.,
18354,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,0,"Ok. Well, my budget is around $9,500 and the listed price is out of my range. The car looks great, however if you're set on the $13,500 price, I won't be able to afford it.",
18355,C_7e7f3f49b544434aa736dfd45a66de1d,1,Alright well you haven't given me any reason to lower my price even though I went against my ad and said that I would be willing to negotiate right out of the gate. Thanks for your interest though.,
18356,C_0218b06251cf47b98caaf276960df496,0,Hello I am interested in buying your Tundra.,

18359,C_0218b06251cf47b98caaf276960df496,1,"No, just all the features that came standard with the car when it was purchased. Satellite radio, Bluetooth, heated seats, etc.",
18360,C_0218b06251cf47b98caaf276960df496,0,"The asking price is quite high for stock features. I'm willing to offer 28,000 for the vehicle after a test drive.",
18361,C_0218b06251cf47b98caaf276960df496,1,"There is no way I'm giving it to you for that cheap. This car goes for way more at a dealership than the price I listed, and it cost even more new. It is in great shape. I can deliver it, fix or change anything you need, whatever you need to accept it at it's price.",
18362,C_0218b06251cf47b98caaf276960df496,0,I could up the price to 33k and we could call it a deal.,
