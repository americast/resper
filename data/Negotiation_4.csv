33,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,Hello,
34,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,Hi there. I had a few questions about the phone you are selling.,
35,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,Sure,
36,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,How old is the phone? I don`t see it stated anywhere.,
37,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,2 years old,
38,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,"Hmm ok. It says it`s like new, but 2 years old could possibly warrant a slightly lower price? Are you open for negotiation?",
39,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,Slightly,
40,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,The highest I can offer is around 100 dollars. Is this too low?,
41,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,Yes,
42,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,What would be your lowest point?,
53,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,hi,
54,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,Hello,
55,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,do you care to make an offer?,
56,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,"The place sounds nice, but may be a little more than I can afford",
57,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,well how much can you soend?,
58,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,I was looking for something in the 1500-1600 range,
59,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,"That is really unreasonable considering all the immenities and other going rates, you would need to come up to at least 3000",
60,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,"I have seen some 2 bedrooms for that price, which I could split the cost with a roommate, so even with amenities, this may be out of my range",
61,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,it may be then... the absolute lowest i will go is 2700. that is my final offer.,
62,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,"Ok, I think the most I could spend on this is 2000 - we are a ways apart",
63,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,ya that is far too low like i said 2700,
64,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,"Ok, thanks for your consideration. I will have to keep looking for now.",
65,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,good luck,
77,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Have the headphones been used?,
78,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,"No, they are new and very nice.",
79,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Can I use them with my gaming console?,
80,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,"Yes, you can.",
81,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Any of them?,
82,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,Yes.,
83,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Do you have one in a different color?,
84,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,"Yes, what color are you looking for?",
85,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Blue,
86,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,I have that color.,
87,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,Which color is this one? 125 a bit pricey,
88,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,1,This one is white.,
89,C_b046547966ae4fb5a83bf75d4fcf3999,0,"I guess it's a deal, lets see what happens if I accept",
150,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,"I am interested in your cubicles, do you know who the manufacturer is?",
151,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"Hello, are you interested in the cubicles I have for sale?",
152,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,"I am interested in your cubicles, do you know who the manufacturer is?",
153,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"No I am not sure exactly, but I know they are very well built .",
154,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,I've seen them sell around $50 individually would you be willing to take $200 for the set?,
155,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,That is way too low for me to go. These are very sturdy and well made . originally cost far more than I am asking. I am willing to go to 380 on the price drop ..,
156,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,That is pretty similar to the cost of new would you be willing to take $225?,
157,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"I think you forget that those cheaper new ones are not the same quality here, also you would be getting the chairs and cabinets as well.",
158,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,I don't want the chairs and cabinets I just want to cubicles.,
159,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"well I am willing to come down , but only to 360 as I can get a better offer for everything as a set.",
160,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,"I really do need the cubicles but I already have the chairs and cabinets, so you could probably sell them and get the rest of your money how about I offer $235?",
161,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"No I am sorry, I know I could much better with what I have to offer. either 360 or nothing..",
228,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,0,Hi there... I am interested ..,
229,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,1,Ok! So what is your price?,
230,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,0,"well I see they say new, so they have never been used?",
231,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,1,Nope! Item is brand new! I am asking $10 for it!,
232,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,0,I am on a budget I was hoping to pay $7.,
233,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,1,Well it is brand! How about $8.,
234,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,0,are there any other perks to this?,
235,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,1,It is compatible with many RIM Blackberry Smartphone PDA models. Is there a particular model you are trying to use the headset for? I can tell you if it is compatible!,
236,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,0,I am just trying to figure out if I GO ABOVE MY BUDGET I AM GETTING A REALLY GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT.,
237,C_3ae4537d69144ebf839fb1e6e1d69d00,1,Well I don't know what else to tell you! My asking price is $10 but I am willing to go down to $8. It is brand new never before used.,

280,C_3cfdfad9aa444a089c7dab41dcb15a4d,1,its used so that is why im selling it for a really good deal of 95,
281,C_3cfdfad9aa444a089c7dab41dcb15a4d,0,Yeah but the amount is too much for me. I can afford to pay 72 for it. That's what I got since its used I would really appreciate if we could work that out,
282,C_3cfdfad9aa444a089c7dab41dcb15a4d,1,this is an antique so although it is used it is very good bookcase,

284,C_3cfdfad9aa444a089c7dab41dcb15a4d,1,90,
285,C_3cfdfad9aa444a089c7dab41dcb15a4d,0,That's too much for me I honestly can't afford that,

372,C_99cb68a1ab614e759675c87c9b3735fa,0,Well that does not look hopeful. I was hoping to get a great deal somewhere around 16000.,

377,C_99cb68a1ab614e759675c87c9b3735fa,1,"i'll take it to thecar wash and get the oil changed, but i'm firm on the price",

516,C_e36c33135f83420283024f68afc6f48f,0,"Yes, is there anything wrong with the phone, perhaps that you could describe in detail?",
517,C_e36c33135f83420283024f68afc6f48f,1,Nothing n g wrong with it.  It's a Samsung hands-free unit still in the box.,

520,C_e36c33135f83420283024f68afc6f48f,0,That's pretty steep. I'd be willing to pay more like $25.,
521,C_e36c33135f83420283024f68afc6f48f,1,It's just below listing price for this model and its brand new. It has accessories and a belt/cider clip I'm throwing in.  $25 is just too low,
522,C_e36c33135f83420283024f68afc6f48f,0,"Well, if you'll provide free shipping I'd pay $33.",

634,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,This mirror is in brand new condition and it is stunning,
635,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,"Brand new? Your listing said you got it from a previous owner, and that it's vintage?",
636,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,"That is true, but it has been kept in brand new condition. I got it from the owner who kept it brand new, and I haven't done anything to damage it at all!",
637,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,Is there anything wrong with the mirror?,
638,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,Nothing at all.,
639,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,"Well, then why do you want to sell it?",
640,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,I don't have anywhere to put it and it is just sitting around,
641,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,"Okay, well, I guess I would offer $125 for the mirror.",
642,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,For a mirror like this in its great condition that is too low. I'd like at least 180 for it.,
643,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,"$180? For that I could buy 3 copies of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the true mirror into the soul of man. The most I would go is $140.",
644,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,1,I'm sorry if you cannot go any higher I am going to have to pass on your offer. It may seem a bit much but it is really a great deal.,
645,C_224d171b6e864e6fb8cb31dcb1e292c3,0,"Okay, I'll settle at $175, and I'll come by your house tonight to pick it up?",

693,C_e2d8a4747960435499418ec7977657dc,0,"I don't know, I only want the table for the melamine table top, and I can buy a brand new one from Ikea for only",
694,C_e2d8a4747960435499418ec7977657dc,1,I mean it is up to you. It is nice. It is already put together. Just put in your vehicle and go.,

718,C_20ff096eb19e48a3ad18ac9d868ed0df,1,"So what do you think of the price? Honestly I'm quite low-balling it here, it's a vintage classic, but I need the space!",
719,C_20ff096eb19e48a3ad18ac9d868ed0df,0,What's the lowest u can go,
720,C_20ff096eb19e48a3ad18ac9d868ed0df,1,I could drop about 10%. How does $3105 sound?,
721,C_20ff096eb19e48a3ad18ac9d868ed0df,0,Is there anything wrong with it,
722,C_20ff096eb19e48a3ad18ac9d868ed0df,1,"The body is antique, but solid metal so no issues. The rest is practically new, and it rides like a beauty.",

2393,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,Howdy Partner,
2394,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,I am selling this nice bathroom sink for 1400,
2395,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,That is a very expensive sink...,
2396,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,"woops actually its an apartment i guess, I only posted 1 picture of a sink",
2397,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,I understand. I'm having one of those mornings myself. It is a nice sink though...,
2398,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,"yes, it is included with this fabulous apartment. It has its own private bath, a ""fresh new look"", and you only have to pay for the garbage man!!!",
2399,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,"That all sounds great. I've been given some advice, I'm not sure if it is good advice though cause it sounds kind of crazy.. I'm told I should only pay 840...",
2400,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,"hmm, I see. Well this apartment is in a nice area, very near to Emeryville Bay Street. West MAcArthur Bart is only 8-10 blocks away. I am asking for 1400 but I can negotiate the price.",
2401,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,Ok I think the advice I have been given can't be good because real estate prices are pretty fixed in my experience... what do you think about 1200,
2402,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,1200 sounds great! I will put that price in the final agreement box so we can close this deal.,
2403,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,0,"Great, thanks",
2404,C_a77a80ffabec4dc68b9d8ace284e1fe7,1,congratulations on your new apartment!,

2408,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well, when you consider the fine crafstmanship, and the fact that it will universally fit in some vehicles, I think $50 is a steal.",
2409,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,That's definitely a good price. My problem is I have only $30 bucks and don't get paid until friday and my friend's birthday is tomorrow.,
2410,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well, that's okay, I can take credit cards through my online store ;)",
2411,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,I can do you one better. I have 5 lbs of gummy bears that have been sealed since I bought them. How about I literally sweeten the deal by giving you all 5 lbs of gummy bears and 30 bucks?,
2412,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well I'm sure that would appeal to some sellers, but unfortunately I'm an end stage diabetic, which is why I have to sell my sub box, so I couldn't eat any sugar :(",
2413,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,"Oh no worries, I have 3 lbs of sugar free gummy bears! Great for diabetics and being constipated! How about I pick that sub box up and drop off the 30 bucks with your sugar free colon cleansers...er...gummy bears?",

2794,C_4d9fcec0966547a9a41768c892673646,1,$4800 is too low for me. It is pretty low miles for a great work truck like this. I can go down to $6000.,

2981,C_019b8f375c824c3eb68f9078c02fb57d,1,"There are no assigned spots, but there is a parking lot which is able to hold many more cars than all of the apartments in the complex need, so parking wouldn't be an issue.",
2982,C_019b8f375c824c3eb68f9078c02fb57d,0,Ok great. I was wondering if you'd be willing to accept $2025?,
2983,C_019b8f375c824c3eb68f9078c02fb57d,1,"Because everything is new and renovated, that's a bit lower than I wanted to go, but I also want you to have a fair price. $2095?",

3836,C_cde4f975a55a4ac1957f5ab316da0d60,1,I could throw in a detailing.,
3837,C_cde4f975a55a4ac1957f5ab316da0d60,1,"No not that low. They are highway miles, oil changed every 3000 miles. I have kept it in good running condition.",
3838,C_cde4f975a55a4ac1957f5ab316da0d60,0,Maybe we could meet in the middle?,
3839,C_cde4f975a55a4ac1957f5ab316da0d60,1,I think we could do that. So 3450?,

3857,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,1,hello,
3858,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,0,Hello! What a beautiful Gazelle!,
3859,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,1,It is! It is well taken care of and it is an original piece from Holland,

3861,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,1,"No, I just got rid of the rust and spent several hours with all the deatils",
3862,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,0,You've done well. Wonder where and what price I could pick up the original seat? Might be hard to find . . .,
3863,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,1,"Maybe you can look it in Amazon, they have almost everything lol. Either way, you can still use it. And the air pump is missing too but I think it is easier to find.",
3864,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,0,"Good point. I've checked around Amazon, but can't find the original seat. Can you accept about $450? That way, I can have a little spare to shop for an original seat.",
3865,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,1,It is hard for me to sell this bike because I love it so much but I have an unexpected medical bill. I will go for 480,
3866,C_c158c3c5f609406291e68216216523fa,0,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that you really don't want to part with the bike and are only doing so becasue you have a medical bill to pay. I have $460 on me to spend today, but if you can hold off until tomorrow morning I can drive by the bank and pick up another $20. $480 is doable, and I'm willing, but as I said, we'll need to wait until morning for the additional $20. Deal?",

3870,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,1,"No sun roof, they were notorious for leaking so when I picked up the vehicle I chose a model without the sun roof.",
3871,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,0,Okay.  I was really hoping for a sun roof.   Could you do $3400?,
3872,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,1,"Well, that's a little less than I was hoping for. Could you come up to $3750?",
3873,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,0,I can come up to 3450,

3875,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,0,Can we meet in the middle at $3500?,
3876,C_e92705747c0544ca9b4986460889b601,1,"Well, I could go as low as $3600, if you're willing to come pick the car up yourself?",

3906,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,1,I could do $240 and transfer the warranty to you. It still has a year on the warranty.,
3907,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,0,the most i could give would be $150 that alll the spare funds i have,

3909,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,0,what about 180,
3910,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,1,I would do 180 if I take out the extra accessories I was throwing in.,
3911,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,0,in that case i would offer $150,
3912,C_bea4e286410542688aa03718bbf88e8b,1,So with all accessories included I suggest we go 200 as that is 50/50 on the original offers,

3983,C_a85d50e268084b3eacb598fbb51afbb0,0,I was hoping to pay more like $85.,
3984,C_a85d50e268084b3eacb598fbb51afbb0,1,Oh no! You might want to come up to $125,
3985,C_a85d50e268084b3eacb598fbb51afbb0,0,"Hmm, pretty high for me still.. any thing I could do to lower that price, say pick it up?",

4043,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,Yes indeed,
4044,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"Do you have any questions? I can tell you that it has not been restored and the asking price is $135, but I am willing to negotiate.",
4045,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"Before we talk price, why wouldn't I want this, Whats wrong with it?",
4046,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this table. It has the expected wear and tear of it being perfectly vintage but other than that it's a beautiful table with smooth working drawers and a very sturdy base.,
4047,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,Why haven't you bothered restoring it?,
4048,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"To keep it as vintage as possible, and for the buyer to restore it as they want, should they see fit.",
4049,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"Well I really can't justify paying $135 for an old side table, I have a budget of $55, so I can do that if you deliver it.",
4050,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"That's quite the drop in price, especially for delivery. I think with delivery added I'll take $100 for it.",
4051,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"I can do $80 and pick it up, meet you sort of in the middle there.",
4052,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"Well, I think we have a deal then. $100 it is, sir.",
4053,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"No, $80.",
4054,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,That's right. $80. I'm sorry about that.,

4061,C_b85915ae4bff4a6abd04b923c4f6520e,1,I am asking $15 for the headphone set.,
4062,C_b85915ae4bff4a6abd04b923c4f6520e,0,I understand that but I am willing to do all the labor so you do not have to pay for gas or shipping. Would you be willing to go down to 9 dollars?,
4063,C_b85915ae4bff4a6abd04b923c4f6520e,1,Nine is a little low.  I would go $12.,

4081,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,1,It was just a little bump I got fixed up after the accident. I claimed it as a salvaged car for insurance purposes.,
4082,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,0,"I see. Well, considering the age and condition. Multiple owners, the salvaged title and all that... I could give you $3,000 for it.",

8067,C_ff8ffd5898d642cc818a6e67a3bc5378,0,I don't think it's worth that much. It's a 12 years old car.,
8068,C_ff8ffd5898d642cc818a6e67a3bc5378,1,"True, but it has power seats and a cd player.",

8073,C_ff8ffd5898d642cc818a6e67a3bc5378,0,It's too high for me. My budget is around $4000,
8074,C_ff8ffd5898d642cc818a6e67a3bc5378,1,"I see. I can come down to $4200, which is one hundred times the answer to everything in the universe, and a very fair price.",
8075,C_ff8ffd5898d642cc818a6e67a3bc5378,0,how about $4100? it's only $100 different but would help me a lot. I can also come to pick up the car so you don't have to deliver.,

10191,C_a1fd34901f38444d9078d87cd63e7127,0,Haha I understand! It's for my husband. He broke his phone and doesn't want to spend a ton on a new one. Would you accept $125? I found a gold one for $120 earlier but it was too far.,
10192,C_a1fd34901f38444d9078d87cd63e7127,1,Ouch!  No.  I'm sorry.  I can only go as low as $300.00.  It has 64 Gigabytes!,

10437,C_a28155c8e949466f8d4bfeaa104f185f,0,It's just that I also need to rent a truck to pick it up so the $301 would make that feasible for me.,

10439,C_a28155c8e949466f8d4bfeaa104f185f,0,That would work. I could pay the $400 if you could deliver it.,

10869,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Ok that all sounds pretty good. Since it's still a used mattress and not a new one I was hoping you could go a bit lower on the price though.,
10870,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,I can give it to you for $250,
10871,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Hmmm my budget for a mattress is not really that high to begin with and it is a used mattress. I was hoping to pay about $135,
10872,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,Woah that's too too low. I am sorry I can't go that low. The last I can do it $200,
10873,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Well like I said it is a used mattress and I am taking quite a risk that it doesn't already have bed bugs or some other issue.,
10874,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,Well there is no such issue. I can give you the cover as well with it if you're interested.,
10875,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Well if the mattress is already used I would definitely at least have to buy a new cover. If the mattress is contaminated then the cover that was being used on it would be too. If I come and pick it up right away and pay in cash could you do $150?,
11006,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,Hey were you interested in the studio?,
11007,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,0,Hello. I'm interested in the studio you have listed.,
11008,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,Awesome. It's good sized for a studio. Did you have any questions about the amenities?,
11009,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,0,"Yes, I was just about to ask. Which amenities are included.",
11010,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,For most all my listing in the area I throw in parking. The laundry room is very close. I also cover everything besides electricity as far as utilities go.,
11011,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,0,"Excellent. It's just what I'm looking for. The only thing is, I'm a little tight on money right now, and I have been looking at a few other properties. I'm looking to pay closer to $812, but I'm willing to negotiate on the price.",
11012,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,You seem like an honest person. I'd be willing to meet you somewhere up in the middle. What do you say we make it 1100 and I'll cover electricity for the first two months?,
11013,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,0,"Can you do $975? I really want this studio, and that's about as much as I can afford.",
11014,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,I'll do 975 and cover electricity for 1 month at that price.,
11015,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,0,That sounds perfect. I will send you an official offer of $975.,
11016,C_17458bff694d4e23b830246b3315ac31,1,Awesome. Enjoy!,

11060,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,1,Good afternoon. Are you interested in the Lumia I have for sale?,
11061,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,1,"As stated in the listing, the screen is cracked, but it is in perfect working condition otherwise. I've lowered the price to $60 and the cost of getting the screen fixed isn't expensive.",
11062,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,0,"Hello, I think we may have our lines crossed... I am interested in the Nokia for sale.",
11063,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,1,"Yes. It is a Nokia Lumia, as stated in the listing. I'm willing to negotiate on the price.",
11064,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,0,"Ok, I think I was getting parts of another conversation.",
11065,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,1,"No, I talked about the crack on the screen, which is clearly stated in the listing. Do you have an offer on the price?",
11066,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,0,"Yeah, considering the screen is cracked I would want to go a bit lower, would you consider $50?",
11067,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,1,I accept your offer of $50 if you can pick it up today.,
11068,C_56e4afcda0814d08b09f5b7d8615aff0,0,"Ok that sounds great, thanks.",
11210,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,0,Hello. How is the couch in great condition?,
11211,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,1,"Well even though we have had it for about five years, we have always kept it as clean as possible.",
11212,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,0,Thanks! Is it comfortable?,
11213,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,1,"Yes, it is extremely comfortable, and it almost has a perfect rating.",
11214,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,0,Sounds good. Would you accept $1345?,
11215,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,1,"That seems a little low, could you go a bit higher?",
11216,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,0,Would you accept $1375?,
11217,C_47c2fabc2c2f46b8ad35fea1a28e0eba,1,Could you do $1395?,

11287,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,1,Absolutely! It's on 3185 Garrity Way in Richmond. It's got beautiful views of the bay and is around a lot of community activites. You can find nature here and you're only 7 miles away from some giant shopping areas. It's the best of both worlds.,
11288,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,0,That's good and is it fully furnished?,
11289,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,1,These are partially furnished and fully renovated units.,
11290,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,0,Great. I am really interested but the price is just holding me back,
11291,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,1,I am willing to give you some wiggle room as long as it's reasonable. Also if you sign a longer lease agreement I can move the price down a bit.,
11292,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,0,Would you be willing to accept 2097?,
11293,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,1,I think we could easily make that work.,
11294,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,0,Great! So deal?,
11295,C_192aeb397b524e5f8c2abaedead516e5,1,Yes! You've got yourself a deal. Enjoy!,

12148,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,0,"Yeah, but it looks like it might need some work that I would have to pay for, so I was hoping I could get it for $850",
12149,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,1,I can't do that. It's been updated recently and has stainless steel appliances. It's a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. 1895 is a steal,
12150,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,0,"I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out?",
12151,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,1,That's crazy. A studio half the size went for 1800. How about 1650? Recently remodeled!,
12152,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,0,It's not the size that I'm basing this on... it's the location and exterior. How about $1000?,

12175,C_a3dac23311854732845e98bf21708cc2,1,I'd be willing to split the difference and go with $370.  Are you paying cash?,
12176,C_a3dac23311854732845e98bf21708cc2,0,I sure am. Would you perhaps do $360 and ill throw in a lawn mow for free?,
12177,C_a3dac23311854732845e98bf21708cc2,1,"I really don't think I can pass that up.  If you're paying cash and mowing the lawn, I'll do the $350 just for you!",

12365,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,
12366,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,
12367,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,
12368,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",

12371,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,
12372,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",
12373,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,

16149,C_c3adbbed9be34cfca21db72ab0d14bac,1,"Oh yeah, it's a medium. Should fit you perfect. I'm only 5'4. You can take it for a test drive, I could bring it buy if that helps you on the price.",
16150,C_c3adbbed9be34cfca21db72ab0d14bac,0,I can't really afford that price any chance you will take $1100,
16151,C_c3adbbed9be34cfca21db72ab0d14bac,1,"Boy, that's low. I really can't. It's barely been ridden and I actually took out a loan on it from my credit union so I still owe $1700. That's my bottom line.",

16156,C_827d3d4c3525458a8f435c0fd4fc1129,1,This is a gorgeous studio on the 6th floor. It is in a quiet neighborhood but very convenient to shops and restaurants. Th estudio has all hardwoods and plenty of storage space.,
16157,C_827d3d4c3525458a8f435c0fd4fc1129,0,"That sounds nice. It's a little bit too pricey for me, though. How does $1200 sound?",
16158,C_827d3d4c3525458a8f435c0fd4fc1129,1,Since the parking spcae is included in the price I can only come down to $1500,

16267,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,
16268,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,
16269,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,
16270,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",
16271,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,
16272,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",
16273,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,
16274,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",
16275,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,
16276,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",

17328,C_6aaa927d0cde4f249cfdb4c3d5a51e77,0,I know the steel frame is custom but it isn't high end enough to justify that price. What features does it come with?,

17346,C_6b2549bd504244c6a901d0dcc8bbfb91,0,I can see that from the pictures. My concern would be the noise level. I usually work from home and feel the noise especially at night would be a distraction.,

17350,C_6b2549bd504244c6a901d0dcc8bbfb91,0,That's still a little out of my range but how does $1300 sound?,
