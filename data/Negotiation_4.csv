67,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,0,"Hi, very well thank you! So, is the DVD player in a good condition?",
68,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,1,It is in great condition. I have barely taken it out of the box.,

72,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,1,I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.,
73,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,0,"Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?",
74,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,1,"I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41.",
75,C_7361593452604767a36a141b8b7adbcd,0,Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay,

155,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,That is way too low for me to go. These are very sturdy and well made . originally cost far more than I am asking. I am willing to go to 380 on the price drop ..,
156,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,0,That is pretty similar to the cost of new would you be willing to take $225?,
157,C_88771d41302946c28a70671aa804cc75,1,"I think you forget that those cheaper new ones are not the same quality here, also you would be getting the chairs and cabinets as well.",

1737,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,Great! Do you have any questions?,
1738,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,0,What year is the car?,
1739,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,it is a 1989,
1740,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,0,How long have you owned it?,
1741,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,"Since '89, Im the only owner the car has had",
1742,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,0,I really need this vehicle to be mobile but I already have so many expenses so I can't afford the asking price of $3000.  Would you be willing to take $2000 if I paid in cash?,
1743,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,$2700 is the lowest I can possibly go. I've put a lot into the car and it shouldnt have any issues or need any major upkeep for the next 50k miles,
1744,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,0,$2300 is the absolute highest I can go.  I've been looking at another hand controlled equiped car for $2200 but it has slightly more miles.  I may have to go with that one if you can't take my offer,
1745,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,"I can go to $2500 if you can come today, but that is the absolute lowest. Like I said it has all the upkeep it needs for a long time and new tires.",
1746,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,0,I'll take it for $2500,
1747,C_e8d05f9bc65447588350d71da8dcfd9f,1,Deal!,
1795,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Hi. I'm interested in buying your end tables.,
1796,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,Great.  You'll love the table it is very high quality.,
1797,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Oh? Is there something special about the item that makes it stand out?,
1798,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"Yes, they are made of high quality oak.",
1799,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,That sounds fantastic. What condition are they in? Any scuffs or marks on them?,
1800,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,They are in good condition.  I could sell one to you for $150.00,
1801,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Any wiggle room there? They really do look fantastic but I'm on a budget. I could pick them up myself for a discount.,
1802,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,I could come down a little if you picked them up. What would you be willing to offer?,
1803,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,"I could offer you 100 dollars cash, tonight.",
1804,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"That might be a little lower than I can take for the table.  If you were able to pick it up and give me $140 cash, I'd do it.",
1805,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,That's a bit too high for me sadly. But because they are such high quality I would be willing to stretch myself. How about we meet in the middle? 125 and I take it off your hands tonight? What do you say? Really can't afford any higher.,
1806,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"You get what you pay for.  I promise you will love this table.  I can come down from my original price, but I still have to get a fair price for the table.  If you can do 129, I'll do the deal.",
1807,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,"I understand that, but since I'm offering a fast easy deal, cash, an picking it up myself I do think that 125 is fair. It saves you the gas. Plus that is honestly all I have on me. I love the item but I can't go borrowing money to buy it.",
1808,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,I really want to do the deal with you.  How about $125 cash and you mow my lawn tonight.  That way you don't have to borrow money and I'll get a fair price for the table.,
1809,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,As long as it's a small one I guess I could do that.,
1822,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,Hello,
1823,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,hello,
1824,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,Were you interested in purchasing this item? Do you have any questions about it?,
1825,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,I am interested in the bike.,
1826,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,Do you have any questions about it I can answer for you?,
1827,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,What color is this bike nad where is the location of the bike?,
1828,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,"The bike is a really nice metallic blue and has white features like white handle grips , white fork and a white saddle.",
1829,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,"would you be willing to take $650.00 cash money, today? I will pick up immediatly!",
1830,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,"That is a good offer, It would be great if you could pick it up , but 650 is a bit too far below asking price. I could go as low as 700 though.",
1831,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,I will take it for $700.00,
1843,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"Hi, are you interested in the car?",
1844,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,Yes indeed. However there are a few things I'd like to talk about.,
1845,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"OK, ask away.",
1846,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,So this salvage title... what made the small accident so small?,
1847,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,We bought this car at a law enforcement auction. The salvage title means you can't register and drive the car. It'f for parts only. There just a small dent in the rear quarter panel. Otherwise the care is in very good condition and low miles. It's a goldmine for parts.,
1848,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,Could I drive it on private lands without issues?,
1849,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"Oh yeah, you can do that. Just stay off of paroled roads. IT's really just for parts. If you have a body or repair shop, then you can charge what ever you want for the parts.",
1850,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,"In that case I think I'm going to have to cut that price in half there, and meet you at $8375.",
1851,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"I could let it go for $12,500. Could you do that?",
1852,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,0,"That's still too low partner, we're looking at maximum $9000. It's a useless car, and will take me a while to sell the parts.",
1853,C_a95429fa0337495eade08a54274fef2b,1,"I'm sad to hear that. My rock bottom price is $11,000.  If you can see your way to make that great.",

1954,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,1,It is only 2 years old.,
1955,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,0,Has the bike had any other owners or just you?,
1956,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,1,The racer Marley Smith was the original owner and she gave it to me.  I don't need it because I have 3 other bikes and no place to keep them.,
1957,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,0,Is the bike deliverable or would I have to pick it up if we come to a deal. That is pretty tough for me.,

1959,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,0,Since Marley raced with it has it been in an accident? Has parts been replaced?,
1960,C_9baf4cf651b745d28648af12eb8edcdf,1,It has never been in an accident but it does have a couple of scratches.  That is why it's priced so low.  Only the chain and tires have been replaced.,

2094,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,0,Yes! Can you tell me about local businesses near the apartment?,
2095,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,1,"Well other then being very close to BART and UC Berkeley there are about 10-15 restaurants in walking distance, along with the standard Walmart and other shopping places of the sort.",
2096,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,0,Are there any negative aspects to the unit/location of the unit?,
2097,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,1,"I personally don't think as this apartment was once my personal place at one point, it's a beautiful/quiet location with no crime or anything of the sort.",
2098,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,0,Well it sounds really great! But I would like to offer perhaps an extended lease or performing a service on the such as purchasing new ceiling fans to lower the price. Would you be willing to negotiate any of that?,
2099,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,1,"I definitely wouldn't have any issues with that, the only reason the price is a little bit higher at the moment is because I am including wifi/cable and all utilities with the apartment, but if you are willing to preform small fix it jobs to the place I don't see any reason why we can't negotiate.",
2100,C_3c0c2b886a474d009d42c465df4b03cb,0,Cool. How does 2000 sound if I sign a 2 year lease and also install all new ceiling fans?,

2162,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,Hello.,
2163,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Yes, hello, are these two pieces of furniture in good condition?",
2164,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,"I would say they are in excellent condition. The covers on the cushions shrunk after we put them in the wash, but other than that there is no wear and tear on the furniture.",

2167,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Okay, well, I suppose I could get some fabric and sew some new seat covers. In light of the work I'd have to put in, I'd be willing to go as high as $500.",
2168,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I'm sorry. I cannot go that low. I need to make at least $1150 off of these items.,
2169,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"I have to provide pickup, and make the covers, there's no way I could go anywhere near that high. I could see $550, that's definitely what I'd like to pay.",
2170,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I could make by with 800$ but I can't get rid of them with that low of a price. I paid way too much for these pieces and I would experience substantial loss.,
2171,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Well, at $800 I'd need some other perks to even consider it.",

2173,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Well, what can you offer me?",
2174,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I can offer you a computer desk to go with it. It's not in great condition but It's wide and has a tower cabinet.,
2175,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Okay, I guess $800 is the price.",

2282,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,Well hello there. Can I interest you in any of these fine goods?,
2283,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,Hmm I think we may have our wires crossed... I'm selling a piece of property...,
2284,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,Oh. This is quite odd. I'm selling a Beautiful Victorian Dresser With Mirror. And you?,
2285,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,I'm selling a Sunny Garden inlaw unit ...,
2286,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,"Hmmmm. What's the estimated price for your goods? Perhaps we can trade. It's unorthodox but heck, aren't all the best things in life?",
2287,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,1500 ...,
2288,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,"Oh wow. Mine is only $299. How about I offer you services in addition to the beautiful dresser from exotic San Francisco California? I groom hamsters, make my own cheese and ice cream and a few other things I can't mention here.",
2289,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,"Well cheese and ice cream sound great but not if you're making them while doing things you can't mention here... and I don't have any hamsters that need grooming.... An exotic dresser sounds great though, and from San Francisco ... I do get tired dressing myself...",
2290,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,"Oh my stars. That's the spirit, partner. Though you have not lived until you try hamster cheese... So how about I offer you zero dollars and send you this lovely dresser. It's quite tolerant being from San Fran and all. And I can have your sunny Garden In Laww",
2291,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,I think I will still need dollars... about 1200 of them...,
2292,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,Harrumph. That is a funky discount. Okay just one question: did the garden marry into your family or was it the other way around? Offer coming shortly it's the most I can do and still keep cheese on the table!,
2293,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,"Sunny married into the family, but we don't like to talk about it...",
2294,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,0,Understood. I'm giving you 1469 and not a dollar more. Thank you!,
2295,C_6dfc974c133c42e0b6fd8e0630d9782e,1,"If you insist, I will accept your offer. Be nice to Sunny, she isn't used to exotic hamster cheese groomers...",
2307,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Hello.  How are you,
2308,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,I'm fine. I'd be a lot better if I could rent this house in your listing.,
2309,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Oh yeah?  WHat do you like about it,
2310,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, the 3 baths seems nice, and I like the square footage.",
2311,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Yeah it's really good for the price.  I'm looking for serious renters,
2312,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I'm a serious renter, but I don't think this price is very serious.",
2313,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,How so?,
2314,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, it seems a little steep. I was thinking something more in the range of $1500",
2315,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"That is impossible.  How about $1900 a month, for two years minimum?",
2316,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I already located this home from a satellite interpolation based on the shadow length, and I know what neighborhood it's in. This isn't the sort of neighborhood that I'd be willing to rent for that much money.",
2317,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"You're right, $2100.  It's extremely clean",
2318,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"It's right next to the Tracy sports complex, in Tracy California. I practically expect to GET paid if I'm moving to California for some reason???",
2319,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,You're the one who messaged me buddy,
2320,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I just saw the beautiful photo of the home, and now I feel like I've been bait and switched! I don't want to move to 2487 Graystone Drive, in Tracy California, not unless I can get a great deal.",
2321,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"Alright, $2000 then",
2322,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Look, I guess if you'll throw in 6 live marijuana plants, I'll consider it a done deal.",
2323,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"SUre, they'll be there when you arrive",
2324,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Okay, great.",

2339,C_c8cf087e134a4ac0a5c38d3c0c265066,1,"Wow, I have not played with Atari since I was in third grade! Go ahead and bring your system. Talk about memories!",
2340,C_c8cf087e134a4ac0a5c38d3c0c265066,0,Alright. Since I'm bringing priceless nostalgia... would you consider taking a chunk off the price of the monitor... like say... 50 bucks...,
2341,C_c8cf087e134a4ac0a5c38d3c0c265066,1,"I really can't do that low, my tiger needs to go to the vet for a massive hairball.",
2342,C_c8cf087e134a4ac0a5c38d3c0c265066,0,Tell you what... I have a brand new tube of Petromalt... tigers love it and it helps clear up those hairballs like magic. I will give you 100 and a full tube of petromalt...I can even scritch the kitty's belly while I'm there...,

2552,C_1cbf9b8ec3ef4375b24fbd39eea405da,1,I'm afraid that is much too low.  How about $590?,
2553,C_1cbf9b8ec3ef4375b24fbd39eea405da,0,"You gave me $10 off, that is pretty generous however I can only do $500 max.  I hope you can meet me there.",

2618,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,I just got a job in the area and plan to live here at least 2 years.  I would be able to sign a 2 year lease if you can give me a better monthly price.  I also can provide great references.,
2619,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,I dont know how much I can do we have other people interested in moving in all the time,
2620,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,"Yes, but probably not two many people that could sign a lease for two years.  Thats two years that you don't have to worry about.  Can you do $1500 and I can start right away",
2621,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,oh no that is impossible I barely break even with the high california taxes and maintenance,
2622,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,"I understand.  What about $1750, remember it is 2 years stress free",
2623,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,I can offer you $2400 it is not much stress I usually have people moving in within 1-2 months,
2624,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,"Ok, I might look elsewhere than, $2000 is my max",
2625,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,Ok good luck then I just cant do it if I am losing money if something needs repaired in the apartment,
2626,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,"Ok, so 8 min lost on this hit because you won't negotiate lower.  Interesting",
2627,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,you can hit quit if no deal made and I am negotiating just not half off lol,
2628,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,0,I went up 500 and you went down 100.  $2200 final offer,
2629,C_1e5f91328c2e4f6f9742abeb6c6276ff,1,you went up 500 from very low not impressive 2300 final offer,
2630,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,Hello how are you,
2631,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,Great! How about yourself?,
2632,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,Super special awesome!  I see you're renting out an apartment,
2633,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,"I am! It's very close to the UC Berkeley campus, and to lots of transit and entertainment options even if you're not a student or faculty. The asking price is $2200.",
2634,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,But what is the neighborhood like?,
2635,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,"It's near campus, and many of the people living in the neighborhood go to Berkeley or teach there. It's also full of things to do and see.",
2636,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,What is the lease agreement you are thinking of,
2637,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,Open to different types of lease agreements if there's something you're looking for. But our standard is a month to month lease with one month's rent as deposit.,
2638,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,Hmmm.  No credit check?  How about $1600 a month?,
2639,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,"$1600 is fine for a deposit, and we're happy to pick you up for a tour of the unit. We generally don't fool with credit checks, especially on month to month leases.",
2640,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,"Alright, I think I can come in later today",
2703,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,How are you?  Great place for $2430,
2704,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,0,I see that how many bedrooms does it have,
2705,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,2 bedrooms I am willing to negotiate a little bit,
2706,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,0,and the schools nearby are they good how about the neighborhood?,
2707,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,"Very good, great location.  Near centennial Park and minutes from San Mateo and Foster City.  Make me an offer",
2708,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,0,would you consider $1800?,
2709,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,I could do $2200,
2710,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,0,That still a little rich for my blood $1900?,
2711,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,"If you can sign a 2 year lease I can go to $2000, but that is the lowest",
2712,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,0,Deal,
2713,C_66c29835af5046c5ad31481ba7ff7fd0,1,sounds good,
2714,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,Would you like to buy a Ballistic iPhone 5 Hard Case?,
2715,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Hi does this case come with a glass protection,
2716,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"Yes, it has a built in screen protector. Just $5",
2717,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Will my phone break at all with this? And can you do $3,
2718,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"No, your phone will be safe with this. I think $4.25 is more than fair.",
2719,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,I mean they don't make iPhone 5 anymore and I really like this particular phone and don't want it to break,
2720,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"I can understand that. It's a very hard case, very durable. It's also shock-absorbent in case you drop it. This thing will definitely protect your phone, very little risk of breaking. $4.25",
2721,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Will it protect in water?,
2722,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"Yes, it has a water resistant mesh that will even protect the speakers. It also has button  & port covers on the case. Want it?",
2723,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Yes I do want it but I honestly only have $3 and I think I'm doing you a favor by getting this off your hands,
2724,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"It is an older case, but there are still a lot of iPhone 5's out there. This case is in new condition as well. $3.00 is just too low. what about $4?",
2725,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Amazon actually has this same case for a $1 i was just instrested in your case because of the color,
2726,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,It is a lovely shade of blue. The lowest I can possibly go is $4. That's less than a sandwich around these parts.,
2727,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,I'm asking you to kindly take $2 off...its just $2 i,
2818,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Hi. Are you interested in apartment?,
2819,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"I'm interested in finding a tenant for the apartment, are you interested in it?",
2820,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Hi. Yes. Thank you. I am interested in your apartment. Is heat included?,
2821,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"No, but I do pay water and garbage.  You'll need to furnish your electric",
2822,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Is there carpeting or wood floors?,
2823,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,It has wood floors throughout but carpeting in the bedrooms.  There is an electric heat pump that works great,
2824,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Okay. About the heat? How much is a typical heating bill during the winter months for this space?,
2825,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"It will depend on your use but I'd say 80-110 is average, bearing in mind it's a large townhome",
2826,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Okay. I was looking at a townhome a few blocks away. They offer free heat and have a big bath with jacuzzi jets. What kind of tub or shower does your place have?,
2827,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,It has a very nice garden tub and shower upstairs and then a half bath downstairs.  Both are newly updated and have new tiles and flooring,
2828,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,I noticed that you are located by a drug-testing facility for recently that is frequented by people on probation and parolees. I am very concerned about that.,
2829,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"Yes I understand that, but we do have a security system in place in the unit that you can activate for a small monthly fee.  I'm asking $1800 for the apartment but I can do $1700 to adjust for the heating cost if that would suit you",
2830,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,I am willing to offer you $1500. I think that is a fair price for the location,
2831,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"Okay, I will accept that offer.",
2832,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Excellent. See you later.,
2833,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,Thank you!,

2861,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,0,"Great, is the price negotiable?",
2862,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,1,"at 15 dollars, it really isnt. I can even drop it off for you, if you would like",
2863,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,0,I really can't spend more than $11.,
2864,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,1,Maybe 13. I can't go any lower.,
2865,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,0,I don't have a penny over $11.,
2866,C_999d2463596e404d9171554f303d7f1a,1,I'm sorry.,
2885,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"Hello, beautiful table, I'm interested in buying it.  Can you tell me what you mean by ""it has a rough character?""",
2886,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,It just means that it is handmade and so that light still shines through the joints. The table is in amazing condition and is a handmade piece.,
2887,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"It's a little small for what you're asking and there's no warranty on it, would you be willing to take $270 for the table?",
2888,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,"The price is firm, I have a little wiggle room, but I couldn't go that low. It is well priced for being a handmade piece.",
2889,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"Well I understand that, but I'm comparing it to several others that I'm considering and it's significantly more expensive.  How about if I come pick it up, would you let it go for $350?",
2890,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,You picking it up is necessary and I would split the difference with you at $400.,
2891,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"Hmm that's just really out of my budget, what if it breaks within the first week?  I feel very uncomfortable about no warranty with this table.",
2892,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,If you pay $400 and pick it up today I will give it a 6 month warranty.,
2893,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"Okay, will you put that in writing when I pick it up?",
2894,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,Sure!,
2895,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,Okay!  I'm on my way!,
2917,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,Hello,
2918,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Hello, I saw your ad for your iphone 7, so it is brand new sealed in box?",
2919,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"Yes, Its completely brand new. Never used.",
2920,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,Will it work with Boost Mobile?,
2921,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,It's unlocked and will work with every service provider.,
2922,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Excellent, I think my only concern is the lack of a warranty.  Do you provide any protection?  What if it breaks within the first week or month of using it?",
2923,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"Good question. It does not have a warranty, but I believe that apple-care is around $99. I could knock off a bit of the selling price so that you could purchase the apple-care. I'm looking to get this off my hands ASAP.",
2924,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Okay, I'm comparing it to several other offers I've seen on ebay.  What about if we do $550 so that I can get that applecare warranty and I'll bring you cash today?",
2925,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"That's a bit low for me. This model sells for around $1,000 if you were to purchase a new one today and the condition of this phone is completely new and untouched. What if I offered $620?",
2926,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"I'm still a little nervous that it won't work with my network, if it doesn't work with Boost will you take it back within 24 hours?",
2927,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,I understand. I would definitely take it back as long as it's within a 24 hour period. You could check with your provider and get back to me. You could also do that while we're together before you even hand me the money.,
2928,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Okay good idea, then let's meet and I'll bring the $620 and call Boost while we're together, sound good?",
2929,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,You have a deal.,
2996,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,1,"It's Night  Owl brand, they are pretty famous",
2997,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,0,"hi, I realize, any scratches on the drawer ?",
2998,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,1,this is odd. i'm selling cameras not dwares,
2999,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,0,I have a wooden drawer from Ethan Allen,
3000,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,1,how much is it going for?,
3001,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,0,70 dollars but i guess it's not valid,
3002,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,1,Well in the interest of a solid outcome we could arrange a swap,
3003,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,0,sounds good to me,
3004,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,1,my cameras are top of the line and 35[0. For one time only i will take 280 worth,
3005,C_6308b51b357041aeb991289e5e40e1ce,0,"it's better we go to a no deal, because I have a 42 limit",
3198,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Hi, I'm interested in the bike you are selling",
3199,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Hello thank you for takning an interest this is a very reliable bike that would make a great addition to any bike ride.,
3200,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,How old is the bike? Does it need anything?,
3201,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,The bike is about 1 year old  as it is a 2016 model. Unfortunately it does lack pedals.,
3202,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,Well I don't mind getting pedals for it.  Could you come down on the price then since I would have to buy them?,
3203,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Sure I wouldnt mind doing so. You could purchase a great pair of pedals for around $60 so ill take $60 off.,
3204,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Oh, that would still be out of my price range quite a bit. I have $1520 in cash and I could pick it up today if you'd accept?",
3205,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Could you possibly go maybe $200 higher? As I said before this is only a 1 year old bike and it does come with various capabilities making it ideal for various terrain.,
3206,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"How about 1680, and I will pick it up within the next hour?",
3207,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,$ 1698 and You got a deal Ill also throw in a full can of rust protectant spray for the chain and any other exposed metal parts.,
3208,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Ok, can you deliver it for that price?",
3209,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,That would depend on distance but yes I certainly could.,
3210,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Ok, I'll take it.",
3221,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Hi! Can you tell me more about this bike? How old is it?,
3222,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,This bike is only two years old. A very sturdy bike constructed from steel. Also it is only slightly used as my child who I orignally bought it for hit a growth spurt shortly after.,
3223,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,"Does it have any issues? Flat tires, faulty brakes etc?",
3224,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,No there are no such issues I had sprayed the exposed metal parts with anti rust. Therefore the brakes still function smoothly. As for tires I had recently ensured to inflate back to the appropriate tire pressure.,
3225,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Would you take $70,
3226,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,That would be a little too low for me. Ihad previoulsy paid around 200 for it brand new so 70 would put me at quite a loss. I could throw in a bicyle bell if that would intrest you.,
3227,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,What about $80 and I'll pick it up?,
3228,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,Would you still want the bell in this case?,
3229,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,No.,
3230,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,Then that would be fine I could also meet you half way if necessary.,
3231,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Perfect,

3292,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,I dont remember exactly but in perfect condition I believe it was 1500 more than my list price.,
3293,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,How about we meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $2300,

3318,C_f67945e6cb6b4a369637a863eef6747a,1,"900 is faaaaarrrrr below market value. I could not go that low. The only way I can negotiate is if I knew about your rental history and willingness to sign a 2 year lease. Anything past 2 years, I am leary of.",

4778,C_0175e2ed1d5c4a4aa96c9d97e6e700b1,0,"But the description says that even though the fridge is in the photos, it's not included. Are you saying there is a fridge now?",
4779,C_0175e2ed1d5c4a4aa96c9d97e6e700b1,1,"Sorry, read that wrong. There is no fridge.",
4780,C_0175e2ed1d5c4a4aa96c9d97e6e700b1,0,"Okay. Are you willing to put a fridge in or do I need to bring one? that will cost around $500. I'm willing to do $1,300",
4781,C_0175e2ed1d5c4a4aa96c9d97e6e700b1,1,"I would be willing, but not for $1,300. The lowest I could go is 1,850 with no furniture left behind.",
4782,C_0175e2ed1d5c4a4aa96c9d97e6e700b1,0,"$1,600 is as high as I am willing to go. I don't need furniture, and it's only 3 bedrooms, plus I'll need to cover utilities",

4795,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Hey that seems to be a nice bike,
4796,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,It is a very nice bike. Can I answer any questions you may have?,
4797,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well any issue with the bike missing pedals or parts and pieces?,
4798,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,All the parts and pedals are in good working condition. This bike has hardly been rode.,
4799,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,I see well lets get into it then now the bike is 3 years so I was thinking your current price is a bit too steep,
4800,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I would be willing to knock $200 of the price.,
4801,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well I was thinking of offering $1320,
4802,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I don't think I could go that low. I could do $1750 if you came and picked up the bike.,
4803,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Well do you have anything you could throw in to make the 17500 a little more encouraging you have to consider the age and also its lack of use there could be parts that are seezing or rusty. Actually what is the condition of the tires and chain,
4804,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I have been riding bikes for several years and I keep this bike in good working order. Since this bike has been upgraded quite a bit I think that would be worth the price since it would keep you from having to upgrade it yourself.,
4805,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,ok can I get you to come down to 1600,
4806,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,1,I could do that.,
4807,C_6cea45c6b91f4aac94a39ca416ab9619,0,Thanks I'd appreciate that.,

4909,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,Hello,
4910,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"Hello, How are you today?",
4911,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"I'm good. I really like the location of the room, are you willing to work some on the price?",
4912,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"I would be willing to be a little flexible. There has been good interest so far, but for the right student, I would make a deal",
4913,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"Don't have to worry about late nights or problems from me. I'm going to school full time and working 20 hours a week, so won't even be there much. Would you be willing to go down to $1,100?",
4914,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"Oh, that sounds like a very busy schedule. With $1100, I don't think I would be able to cover the cost of utilities. Did you see that they were fully included? If you are able to sign a lease today, I could do $1275",
4915,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"I'd be willing to work a few hours of maintenance each week if you could go $1,150. That's as high as I can go.",
4916,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"Can you talk about your maintenance experience? With a full time class load and 20 hours of week elsewhere, what type of time do you think you would have to dedicate to work here?",
4917,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"I've worked for a landscaping company every summer for 4 years. My father is a contractor,  and I've also worked with him.  My job is all weekdays, so my weekends would be open.",
4918,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"How about 1250. You are responsible for 6 hours of work a month assigned by the property manager. That works out to a rate of about $25.00 discount, but you would be responsible for paying the full balance if you are not able to complete the work. If you are a good employee, I think we could consider additional hours,and further reduction after a trial period.",
4919,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,I just don't think I can afford that.,
4920,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,0,"Hello, is there a weight restriction on this tractor?",

4925,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,1,"Per the picture, it has been gently used.  It is in mint condition, i.e. very good condition.",
4926,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,0,Since there seems to be alot of unknowns with this item would you be willing to accept $322?,
4927,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,1,I would be willing to take $25 off the original price of $350 to cover the unknowns.,
4928,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,1,Making the purchase price $325 and I will include free shipping.,
4929,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,0,That sounds like a fair trade to me.,

5243,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,do you smoke?,
5244,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,"nope, lamp is from a smoke and pet free home",
5245,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,"well that is important, can you tell me what type of silk the shade has on it?",
5246,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,teal silk from Italy. I had the lampshade made out of a scarf I bought on a cruise. The lamp itself is less than 3 months old.,
5247,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,that sounds lovely but I am on a budget. I was hoping we could negotiate the price down.,
5248,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,"I'd be willing to take $60 but I'd have to take the lightbulbs out and replace them with basic bulbs,",
5249,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,Could we do 55?,
5250,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,sure,
5251,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,"Hey, can you tell me a little more about the apartment's lease terms? Are they negotiable? I'm a Stanford student and we're on the quarter system, so I would need the lease to continue through the end of June instead of the end of May.",
5252,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,I think we could work something out.  It's only a 30 day extension correct?,
5253,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,"Yes, that's correct.",
5254,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,Will you still want to move in August?,
5255,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,Could I move in September instead? Our classes don't start until mid-September.,
5256,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,September 1 to August 31 I could make that work.  Will it be just for yourself?,
5257,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,"Awesome. I've got three Stanford friends with me, so they'd be in the other bedrooms and would also move in on September 1.",
5258,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,ok.  will you be able to afford $1998 per person per month?,
5259,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,"Honestly that amount is a lot more than I'm comfortable with, since I'm on student loans. But since you're willing to change up the lease terms regarding move-in and move-out date, I can be a little flexible. Could you do $7000 from all four of us, per month?",
5260,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process.,
5261,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,Ok that works. Thanks so much.,
5262,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,sure no problem,

5729,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Ok well im working with a budget of 684. Now i should remind you this is still a used bike and even with your upgrades it wouldn't push it too 900 I could get a completely stock bike for 779,
5730,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,"I am actually taking a loss asking the $900. I am willing to negotiate on the price, however, I cannot go that low.",
5731,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Well yes selling this.  Bike without much use.  Is certainly a loss for you but i did my reasearch and your exact model and your upgrades have gone down in price when bought brand new now a brand new bike with those up grades would run me about 820 so that would certainly mean your bike value has significantly reduced. If 684 is too low I can do 699 and i will pick it up,
5732,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,This bike was only used three times and it has been parked in a garage. It is very clean with many upgraded parts. I could do $790 and I will deliver it to you.,

5874,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"Hi, you inquired about the IPAD I have advertised? What questions can I answer for you?",
5875,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,How old is it?,
5876,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"Great question. It is only a year old. I decided to get the next generation. I love to get new gadgets as soon as they come out so every year, I upgrade",

5878,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"It is in excellent condition. I usually use my Mac Pro book to do all my work on. The Ipad is just for reading in bed at night until I fall asleep. I have all the original accessories that came with it, plus I have all the latest apps.",

I have gone over two weeks without charging it but I make sure to charge it once a week so the batteries will last",
5881,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,0,Sounds good.  The only issue I have is that the image on the add is broken.  So I would be forced to take your word 100% on the condition and accuracy of the item.  Will you sell it to me for $150?,
5882,C_c438481db2e04f6d83191a1ba634b1a0,1,"I can assure you that you will not have to take my word for anything. Since we are in the same city I will deliver the product or we can meet up in a public place and you can see it for yourself. I am letting it go for way more than it is worth at $175. Even a refurbished one, which has damage would run you $250 or more in the store. This one is in pristine condition, plus I have over $1000 of software that I purchased on there.",

6396,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,"OK, that's good.  It says High Speed Internet Access. Who is the provider and is that included in the rent or do we pay separately?",
6397,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,1,"We have XFINITY, which is Comcast, and its included in the rent.  Also included in the rent are the appliances such as laundry, washer, dryer, gas stove and range, as well as a fitness center. Seems like a good deal, no?",
6398,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?,
6399,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,1,"Well no, I don't believe any place includes the water and electricity at this price. We'll take care of the garbage and take it out for you, and no, the fee is included for the swimming pool because we have staff that maintain it.",
6400,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,"Well, that doesn't sound like a bad deal.  I think we will submit an offer for it.",

6537,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,1,well did you know that it was teak? that is a very expensive wood. the listing price is 895. 400 is too low,
6538,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,0,Really? The previous ad had a brand new one listed for 500 dollars?,
6539,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,1,it likely was not in the good condition this one is in. perfect condition. 800 would be a really good deal.,
6540,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,0,I could go 500 but I don't see how it could be in better condition that the new one.,
6541,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,1,"yes, I understand that but sometimes factory seconds with slight flaws will get sold new at that price. sounds like thats what they were selling",
6542,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,0,"Maybe, I could go as much as 550 and my neighbor has a truck so we can pick it up today. Otherwise it might be sitting in your garage for a while.",
6543,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,1,could you go to 700? that way I won't be losing too much on this one.,
6544,C_092fd74083ab42868e24e2b544ba458c,0,Sorry 600 is the most I could do. Otherwise I'd be better off going with the other cabinet.,

6590,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,How does 5500 sound? That is within my budget.,
6591,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,1,It sounds way too low.  If you come up some more I'm sure we can meet in the middle somewhere.,
6592,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,How about 8000? That seems like a good meeting point for us.,
6593,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,1,I think we can meet more at 9000.  I just put 4 new tires on it.,
6594,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,8700 and not a penny higher. How does that sound to you?,

6771,C_43128b6a095b4e09a3e522bce55bd3fe,1,either way is fine.  I have an office on Main if you want to meet there or pick it up  there during business hours,

6896,C_a8cb1ae95b0f46429913e1f14f834e09,1,"This table is worth at least $600. It's very sturdy. My 200 pound wife sat her fat butt down on it, and it didn't even creak.",
6897,C_a8cb1ae95b0f46429913e1f14f834e09,0,So you are giving a $100 discount from what the store sells it for?,

6928,C_1a848cb512cd4e4c9963312577925034,1,"It's historically registered. It has some meaning to the community ad scholars. Plus, you get all three stories to yourself.",
6929,C_1a848cb512cd4e4c9963312577925034,0,What's the area around it like?,
6930,C_1a848cb512cd4e4c9963312577925034,1,"Downtown Livermore is a quaint village with character. Public transportation is nearby, and there are a lot of neat little shops.",

7084,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,1,That's a little too steep of a discount. It's almost brand new.,

7227,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,"I was thinking $25 for it, what do you say?",
7228,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,I can't it go for less than $30,
7229,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,"I'm low on money, can you do $28?",
7230,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,"Sorry, I can't. It was $55 new",
7231,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,0,What if In pick it up? And pay $29?,
7232,C_eb563273363b4db7a04a7ffbb885abc8,1,That would work!,

7280,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Hello,
7281,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,Hello,
7282,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Did you have any questions about the lamp?,
7283,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"Yes, how much did you pay for the lamp?",
7284,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,I spent $250 for it and it is absolutely worth the price but i just doesn't work with the design in my living room so I'm offering it for only $200.,
7285,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,I would love to buy the lamp but the most I would be willing to budge would be $140.,
7286,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,Hmmm that is quite a low offer. It is only a week old and you'd be paying a lot more than that to buy it new.,
7287,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"Yes, but the item is simply not new and has faced depreciation.",
7288,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,"Not really, and not nearly as much as you are suggesting. But I'll tell you what, if you can make the $200 I will throw in a Serge Mouille sconce, not reproduction but original Serge Mouille, it matches his lamp perfectly of course, I'll throw that in for the full $200 if you can pick them up right away.",
7289,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,0,"I would not be interested in that item, only floor lamp itself. What is your best counter offer on the lamp?",
7290,C_d9aa73de1c2c418d9c8a24eebced10e2,1,I'm going to hold firm on the $200 since you're not being at all reasonable and made such a lowball offer.,
7312,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,Hello. Are you still selling the bike?,
7313,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"I've had a few offers, but I'm willing to see what you have to say",
7314,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,How old is the bike and what kind of condition is it in?,
7315,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"It's a vintage, so it has a great personality!  Haha it's actually in great condition, I was never really able to use it much",
7316,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,Okay and it has also been repainted right?,
7317,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"Yes, I got it professionally done",
7318,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,That's good but with the original paint it would be worth more. Would you sell it for 140?,
7319,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"That's pretty low.  Even sanded down, this bike is worth 190.  Lowest I can go is 200 with what I put into it already (mods and painting)",
7320,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,"Modifying it actually decreases the value too, customizing something makes it worth less you don't just add on the cost of custom parts. That takes away any value it had as a vintage item.",
7321,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"Hmm, well it sounds like you probably aren't interested then.  As a non-vintage bike, it's worth 200.  The vintage should add on to it.  Lowest I'll go is 180 if you pick it up.",
7439,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,"Hello, are you interested in the item for sale",
7440,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Yes I am interested but could you tell me what condition is it in?,
7441,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,Are you interested in purchasing this item,
7442,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Yes. What condition is it in though?,
7443,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,it is in great condition.,
7444,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Why are you selling it?,
7445,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,We've had some financial troubles this year. Just trying to make ends meet.,
7446,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,"Okay would you take $2,000 for it? sounds like you really need the money",
7447,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,"Unfortunately I can't go that low, I'm think more in the $3500 range. As you can see from the ad, this bike has a great deal of upgrades and customization. It's really a steal at this price",
7448,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,"Upgrades and customization don't really add value to something if you're selling it to someone else. I'll give you $2,100",
7449,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,Hi are you still selling the spider?,
7450,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,1,Yes it's still here for sale.,
7451,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,What condition is it in is there anything wrong with it?,
7452,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,1,"It's in mint condition actually, nothing wrong at all. No scratches, no dings, everything is perfect.",
7453,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,That's good. Are you flexible on the price?,
7454,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,1,I can work with you on the price but no low ball offers.,
7455,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,"Would you take $2,000 for it?",
7456,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,1,"No that's too low, remember this is in mint condition, perfect condition and it has only 150 miles on it.",
7457,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,"Okay will you take $2,500?",
7458,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,1,2600 if you come and pick it up.,
7459,C_64b9148820fd4bbca6b6b898a41d8d64,0,Okay we have a deal.,
7460,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,"Hello, I'm interested in your rental property.",
7461,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Great it is 1595 a month with a security deposit equal to 1 month rent unless of course your have great or really damaged credit.,
7462,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,That sounds like a great deal but the best I can comfortable afford is $1350.,
7463,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Well as I am just an agent for the owner I do not have all that much wiggle room but if you would be willing to sign a lease for longer then one year I may be able to help you out a bit.  Is that something that you would consider?,
7464,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,A lease for a year doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. I could push for $1480. Is that something you can agree too?,
7465,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,"In order for me to go down to 1480 I would need you to sign a 2 year lease.  Keep in mind that this does include lawn maintenance as well as hoa fees.  There is also a pool, club house and rec center that you will have access to as a member of this community.",
7466,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,Hmm... those sound like nice things to have. However I'm not too sure if I should sign a 2 year lease. What range are you looking for in order for me to sign a 1 year lease?,
7467,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Well the owner does not want us to go any lower on a 1 year lease but let me ask how is your credit?  The reason that I ask is because if you have a score over 700 I can waive the security deposit.,
7468,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,"I would say my credit is fairly good. I'm also starting to think that a 2 year lease isn't really a bad idea. Oh, alright! I'll take the risk! I could make some good friend along the way too. So are you still willing to accept $1480 is I sign a 2 year lease?",
7469,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Yes that is correct.,
7470,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,Very nice! Thank your for working this out with me!,
7531,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,0,Hey I wanted to ask about your chairs.,

7533,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,0,Are they in good condition? How much use have they seen?,
7534,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,1,"They are in great condition, very little use. I am just upgrading to a new office.",
7535,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,0,"Okay well I only really need 5 chairs, and the bulk price for that is much lower if I buy them at the local warehouse. Can you lower the price at all?",
7536,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,1,How much were you thinking about?,
7537,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,0,How about 500 for 5 chairs?,
7538,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,1,I was hoping for 700 since you could still sell the other 2. How about 550 for all 7?,
7539,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,0,That would be great thanks!,
7540,C_ed4e0fbc5868443f9f75974c27c733b7,1,Ok. 550 it is. You can pick them up whenever. Have a nice day.,

7610,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,1,88000.  It wasn't driven too much.,
7611,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,0,"88000 is a lot of miles for a domestic vehicle though, it doesn't have much life left in it. Does it have GPS?",
7612,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,1,"I recently dropped the asking price for that reason but Lincoln's usually run over 100K easy so there is still some life left in it.  Yes, it has GPS plus backup camera.  I recently dropped the asking price.",
7613,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,0,Would you take 3000?,
7614,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,1,"Its fully loaded, clean title, registration is up to date, plus the I have smog certificate in hand.  I will be willing to go 4000",
7615,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,0,"4000 is good for me, you got yourself a deal!",

7930,C_06c46710e46443b2a7906711c1f1a0c7,0,"yes, but most places have at least all needed appliances or include utilities. ill admit the laundry service, pool, and gym are attractive benefits though. how about $1500 to move in-- i could sign the lease this afternoon.",

15749,C_62a68ddb47644c69be3e6131341fda32,1,Unfortunately it doesn't. Would you pay $50?,
15750,C_62a68ddb47644c69be3e6131341fda32,0,I can do $50,
15751,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,0,Hello? I'm interested in the lovely home you have rent.,
15752,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,1,Hi!  I'm happy to hear of your interest in the property.  Do you have any questions that I can help you with?,
15753,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,0,How much are you asking for rent?,
15754,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,1,"It is listed at $2995, but I'm willing to work with the right tenant.",
15755,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,0,"I'm on  a budget, and would like to go down to 1497.",
15756,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,1,"I know what it's like to be on a budget, but $1497 is just too low.  It is recently updated and is 3 bed/1 bath.  It also includes a washer and dryer in to $2500.",
15757,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,0,I like the idea of the washer and dryer. Are you willing to work with the deposit?,
15758,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,1,"Yes, that is negotiable.  I'd be willing to bring the rent down to $2500/month with a deposit of half ($1250).",
15759,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,0,Sounds great to me!. I accept the 2500.,
15760,C_6a78285a6ce24a12b0e7271f80944083,1,Excellent.  We have a deal!,
15899,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,Hello! Are you interested in my wonderful land rover?,
15900,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Possibly! It looks promising from what you've listed there -- but I note that it is pretty old. A 2001 model. What kind of mileage are we talking about?,
15901,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,It has 230000 miles. It is a bit old but it has a clean title and passed the smog recently. Also no scratches or dents!,
15902,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Sounds roughly par for the course. What's shaken loose after all those miles? Have there been any major repairs?,
15903,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The only thing wrong with it is a cracked windshield. Other than that tires are great and it runs amazing,
15904,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"So, being a 2001 model -- what can you tell me about its car seat compatibility?",
15905,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,It has all the belt attachments on the back for car seats. We used it with all my kids and never had problems,
15906,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"Now. It does sound like it's a solid hunk of metal -- but the age of the thing does give me pause when I consider I'm going to be putting my kids into it. It's not failed yet, but I can't help but wonder when the other shoe will drop.",
15907,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The older the better! Now days all new cars are made with cheap metal that gets destroyed easily in if you crash. How about we settle for 2800?,
15908,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"Okay, good point. 2500 and we've got a deal.",

15950,C_0da95c24e7e64d7c9fc308735d6f891b,1,How about 150 and I deliver it?,
15951,C_0da95c24e7e64d7c9fc308735d6f891b,0,I can do $135 cash and you deliver it?,
15952,C_0da95c24e7e64d7c9fc308735d6f891b,1,135 and you pick it up,

16118,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,0,I am interested in renting the apartment listed in the ad!,
16119,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,1,Great. It's a 3 bedroom one bathroom the kitchen was re-done in 1997 so it's not brand new but it's in great shape,
16120,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,0,1997 was quite some time ago. It seems the rest of the place is great. Would there be any wiggle room with the price since the renovation was 20 years ago?,
16121,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,1,Well that's actually newer than the majority fo the places around since it's in a historic area.,
16122,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,0,"Yes, that's why I wanted to move to the neighborhood. I'm quite handy around the house and my significant other works for a general contractor. Maybe we could work out a deal where we could do some improvements ourself for a reduced rent?",
16123,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,1,What type of reduction did you have in mind?,
16124,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,0,We could pay $2000 a month and pass all upgrades through you prior to installation?,
16125,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,1,Deal. Just make sure we discuss any upgrades since we need to keep it pretty superficial.,
16126,C_bcfeb9a3e84b4114b332bea800b68854,0,"Absolutely. No torn down walls, just counters, appliances, and cabinets. Deal.",

16129,C_f7fffd6af4f946f0ad67de0c570788bb,0,How many miles does she have on her?,
16130,C_f7fffd6af4f946f0ad67de0c570788bb,1,"Do not drive it all the time. I has just 75,000",
16131,C_f7fffd6af4f946f0ad67de0c570788bb,0,I was hoping to make $7500 offer on the 2005 model. What do you think?,
16132,C_f7fffd6af4f946f0ad67de0c570788bb,1,"Great but too low. Add $5000 and i can give it away at $12,500",
16133,C_f7fffd6af4f946f0ad67de0c570788bb,0,Does it hae any more perks that would make that a good deal?,

16335,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,0,is that negotiable?,
16336,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,1,I can give it to you for $40,
16337,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,0,40 is a little high. I can come and pick it up all the way at your house if that helps.,
16338,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,1,What price are you thinking?,
16339,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,0,I was thinking $30,

16377,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,Very well can you tell me a little about the property?,
16378,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,1,"It is a beautiful condo, it was just fully remodeled. Has great big walk in closets, a huge back and side yard. Best school district.",
16379,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,That all sounds great it's just a little over my budget. Would you be willing to accept 1746 if i gave security deposit and 3 months rent upfront?,
16380,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,1,Well that is much lower than asking price. How long of a lease were you thinking of signing? If it were a short lease I think I could consider a price that low.,
16381,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,6 months,
16382,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,1,"For a 6 month lease, where you're putting up security plus 3 months I could definitely meet that price. However when that lease is up we would not be able to renew at that price.",
16383,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,That is understandable if i like the condo we can renegotiate then!,

16394,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,Hey,
16395,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,are you interested in the apartment?,
16396,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,"I'm pretty interested, but I'm not sure it's worth what you're asking",
16397,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,"Well the area is too good, and the apartment has been remodeled fully. I am open to negotiating though. What do you have in mind?",
16398,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,"I would be willing to pay $1100 and I can offer services around the apartment, like I will do basic repairs and yardwork.",
16399,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,Okay that sounds good but you will have to be working 30 hours around the apartment. Is that okay with you? to make up for the price?,
16400,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,30 hours a month? sure.,
16401,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,Okay then we've got a deal! Thanks,

16415,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,0,Is it close to any restaurants or stores?,
16416,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,1,"Yes, there is a freeway nearby that you can use to get anywhere.",
16417,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,0,I have $1375 cash right now in can bring it you right now.,
16418,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,1,"That is pretty low. Can you afford a bit more, like 2400?",
16419,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,0,Yes can we meet up right now?,
16420,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,1,"Sure, I can. Is that price okay with you?",
16421,C_27ad41383ca24e1aa7b3592a8ad52c95,0,Yes that price will work for me.,

16444,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,0,Is there any scratches on this?,
16445,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,1,No scratches or marks. It is in great shape.,
16446,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,0,Do you know how old it is?,
16447,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,1,About two and a half years. There were no pets or smoking in the home.,
16448,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,0,Any wiggle room on the price?,
16449,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,1,I can go a little bit lower. Would $75 be acceptable?,
16450,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,0,I was looking for more towards 60,
16451,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,1,Would you be interested in $68 if I throw in a wooden DVD storage unit with the same finish?,
16452,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,0,Yes actually I would love that!,
16453,C_cf7a097564eb4728aacd78e7794de3ca,1,Sounds great. Thank you for your time and patience.,

20622,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,0,okay sounds good to me. WHat about the price? Its way too high for me. Is there room for negotiation here?,
20623,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,1,I could come down to 15000 and throw in a 2 year warranty on the power train. I can also give you the first 3 oil changes for free.,
20624,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,0,Wow my budget is somewhere around $10990,
20625,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,1,"I just can't do that low, i'm sorry. I tell you what I'll do 14500 for you. it is a good price for a car 1 year old with only 1523 miles.",
20626,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,0,Does 12000$ sound reasonable? Please I am really on a tight budget?,
20627,C_e4dc18e558234010a3772d8a06597a5b,1,I'm sorry but that's 5000 under the blue book value of this car.  My final offer is 14000 that's the best I can do. I need to pay off the car myself.,

20685,C_67a220ceedbe4fe18499d553646844cb,0,"Great! How's the body of the bike, any dents or scratches?",
20686,C_67a220ceedbe4fe18499d553646844cb,1,"The body is pretty good but the paint could use refreshing. What it lacks in beauty, it more than makes up for in comfort. :)",
20687,C_67a220ceedbe4fe18499d553646844cb,0,What kind of seat does it have? Is it the normal padding or memory foam?,
20688,C_67a220ceedbe4fe18499d553646844cb,1,It's not memory foam but it is a high grade foam. Just as comfortable for a fraction of the cost. I work on bikes as a mechanic and this one is my baby. But I'd rather see her used than sitting in storage. $60 and she's yours.,
20689,C_67a220ceedbe4fe18499d553646844cb,0,Would you take $54?,

20790,C_6bd042550d784fb69a5a5d1eaf3831ff,0,"Okay, so it doesn't pull out. That's cool, but the price is a bit much for me. How about $200 for it?",
20791,C_6bd042550d784fb69a5a5d1eaf3831ff,1,i will take $250 for this couch it turns into a bed is is worth every penny.,
20792,C_6bd042550d784fb69a5a5d1eaf3831ff,0,But it doesn't actually pull out into a bed. I'd have to push the pieces together which isn't what I was looking for. I'm still willing to take it off your hands though. How about $235 and I'll pick it up?,
20793,C_6bd042550d784fb69a5a5d1eaf3831ff,1,i will do the $235 if you can arrange to pick up.,

21004,C_0f08ed7e22e4466dbe36c8932f643daf,0,Why are you selling it? Did you buy it yourself?,
21005,C_0f08ed7e22e4466dbe36c8932f643daf,1,"Yes, I am selling due to getting another model I wanted over this one.",

21011,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Possibly! It looks promising from what you've listed there -- but I note that it is pretty old. A 2001 model. What kind of mileage are we talking about?,

21013,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Sounds roughly par for the course. What's shaken loose after all those miles? Have there been any major repairs?,
21014,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The only thing wrong with it is a cracked windshield. Other than that tires are great and it runs amazing,

21017,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"Now. It does sound like it's a solid hunk of metal -- but the age of the thing does give me pause when I consider I'm going to be putting my kids into it. It's not failed yet, but I can't help but wonder when the other shoe will drop.",
21018,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The older the better! Now days all new cars are made with cheap metal that gets destroyed easily in if you crash. How about we settle for 2800?,
