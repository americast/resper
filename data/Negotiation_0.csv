I almost feel like I'm expected to spend 5-10 minutes on every trade? Do you ever get that feeling?",
2228,C_2bdb308591df45e29a321a7cfd167002,0,Not at all.  I suggest you seek help at a mental health professional immediately.  But not before mailing my Ottoman thingy to a neutral address,

2635,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,"It's near campus, and many of the people living in the neighborhood go to Berkeley or teach there. It's also full of things to do and see.",
2636,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,0,What is the lease agreement you are thinking of,
2637,C_332ae7de2aca412e80973717c03a8803,1,Open to different types of lease agreements if there's something you're looking for. But our standard is a month to month lease with one month's rent as deposit.,

2718,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"No, your phone will be safe with this. I think $4.25 is more than fair.",
2719,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,I mean they don't make iPhone 5 anymore and I really like this particular phone and don't want it to break,
2720,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"I can understand that. It's a very hard case, very durable. It's also shock-absorbent in case you drop it. This thing will definitely protect your phone, very little risk of breaking. $4.25",

2723,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Yes I do want it but I honestly only have $3 and I think I'm doing you a favor by getting this off your hands,
2724,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,"It is an older case, but there are still a lot of iPhone 5's out there. This case is in new condition as well. $3.00 is just too low. what about $4?",
2725,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,0,Amazon actually has this same case for a $1 i was just instrested in your case because of the color,
2726,C_4b2d7e3b0c6543b5b9665b2c12aa45f2,1,It is a lovely shade of blue. The lowest I can possibly go is $4. That's less than a sandwich around these parts.,

2877,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,"I'm sorry but I'll have to insist that you stay in a two bedroom. Those are the rules with children. It's very important to use all of the rooms as intended here at Cinnamon Apartments. However, you mentioned the pool earlier. Do you enjoy swimming?",
2878,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Yes we do. I would still like a 2 bedroom, but I'd be willing to do without the wall to wall closets and breakfast bar.",

2962,C_dc03e5c64927484dbf140e0f438fe761,1,yes,
2963,C_dc03e5c64927484dbf140e0f438fe761,0,"Ok, well for $170 I think it's a pretty good deal since you say it's like new. I'll pay $170 for it.",
2986,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,1,how are you,
2987,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,0,"Hi, I'm well and yourself?",

2989,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,0,"Yes, I am very interested.  Have you had it long? Does everything work properly?",
2990,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,1,I haven't had it long and everything works great.  Make me an offer.  I am willing to negotiate,
2991,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,0,Does it have a warranty?,
2992,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,1,"Yes, through Canon",
2993,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,0,"Oh, that's great. Could you come down to $92 for it?",
2994,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,1,"$92,  Yeah I think I could do that for you.",
2995,C_2c78db50022b453aae25995d2488278d,0,"Awesome, thank you!",
3030,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,how are you,
3031,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Hello, I'm great.  I'm interested in your apartment, can you tell me how many square feet it is?",
3032,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,100 sq',
3033,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Wow, that's much smaller than I thought.  And it does not have a washer/dryer inside the unit?  Is it shared with the other people in the complex?",
3034,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Yes they are shared.  I am willing to lower the price a little, make me an offer",
3035,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Okay, will you take $900? 100 square feet is just much smaller than I anticipated but I guess I could squeeze my bed in there if you'll drop the price a bit.",
3036,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,I can go to about $1300 but that is probably my lowest.  The location is amazing,
3037,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Yes I see that the location is great, does that 100 square feet include the bathroom or is that additional square footage?",
3038,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Sorry, I meant the bathroom is 100 sq ft :)  total is about 500 sq ft",
3039,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Ohhh okay, that's much better.  I was a little concerned!  Okay, how about will you take $1200 for it and I will bring the money and ID to apply today?",
3040,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Sounds good, $1200",
3151,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,1,Hi,
3152,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,0,Hello can you tell me how old this bike is?,
3153,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,1,"It's only about 3 months old, it is my wife's but its a little too large for her.",
3154,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,0,Is everything in working order?,
3155,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,1,"Yes it works great, almost new. Only has 50 miles on it.",
3156,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,0,That's great. I just have a tight budget this month and need a new bike to get to work. Can you go any lower on the price?,
3157,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,1,I can negotiate a little. What did you have in mind?,
3158,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,0,I was hoping for 900$ that leaves me a little breathing room in the budget. Just need a good sturdy bike to get to work.,
3159,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,1,I could do $950 and I'll even throw in an automatic tire pump and deliver it.,
3160,C_c35e2a9bd1e5405c8655bfa21ad2662a,0,That would be super!,
3287,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,"Hello, I'm interested in this 2005 Caddy. What kind of shape is the engine in?",
3288,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,In terms of appearance the engine has been detailed so everything is clean.,
3289,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,"Welp, considering that this a 2005 with 120k miles on it, has small dents and the rivets on the hood because of a previous rack, I'm prepared to offer $2160.",
3290,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,Well what if I threw in some rim locks tor prevent anti rim theft and also a slightly used sun shade for the dash would that be able to get you up to 2500,
3291,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,"Nah, I don't need any of that but thanks anyway. Do you know what the blue book price is for this car in this condition?",
3292,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,I dont remember exactly but in perfect condition I believe it was 1500 more than my list price.,
3293,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,How about we meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $2300,
3294,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,at that price Id only be able to trow in the sunshade for the dash.,
3295,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,I don't need the sunshade :),
3296,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,1,then Id certainly be willing to go for that. However I could deliver it to you for 200 more?,
3297,C_9042452974bd44a9be5ed6eebf00beda,0,Nah that is okay. I'll come get it myself for $2300,
3322,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,"Hello, are you interested in this bike?",
3323,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,0,"Hello, I am interested in the bike.",
3324,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,Do you have any questions about it?,
3325,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,0,"It seems like it's in great shape, but are there any issues with it that aren't listed? I am on a budget on what I can spend so I need a good deal please :)",
3326,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,"None, at all. Like I posted it's all custom built and if you have issues you can bring it in and we'll fix it for you.",
3327,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,0,"Okay, sounds good. I would like to offer 485 for the bike. I know it may sell new higher, but even though it's a great bike, it's still used so more likely to have some issues pop up sooner.",
3328,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,"Yes, not going to be able to do it at that price. The parts cost more than that.",
3329,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,0,"Well, as I really am on a budget, I can go up to 532, but that is really the most I can pay for the bike. I just can't afford a higher price.",
3330,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,The lowest I can go is 600.,
3331,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,0,Let's meet in the middle at 550 and that would work out well for both of us.,
3332,C_5f67770b7c614948af7971685e6d4338,1,Ok that works for me. Thank-you.,
3343,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Woud you be willing to go lower?,
3344,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,I could go to 250.,
3345,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,But you see you already put the price in so we cant negotiate. For the future negotiate first then price or else we will get the hit rejected.,
3346,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,Oh sorry. I guess I misunderstood that part. I can help deliver it to you.,
3347,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,That is certainly appealing as I do not have the neccessary equipment to move the set. A uahul would probably run me an extra 300.,
3348,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,Probably. So for 275 I'll deliver it. Sound good?,
3349,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Yes but one thin how worn is the bed and base has it been used for any intense activities?,
3350,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,The bed is not worn more than normal for being used for 9 months. The frame is great and Tempur Pedic box springs are very reliable. Nothing intense has happened.,
3351,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Good cause Id personally feel uncomfortable if any activities like when a mommy and daddy like each other very much took place on it. Ok Id be willing to accept your offer.,
3352,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,"Nothing like that happened. Great, it's a deal.",
3365,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,Hello are you interested in my subs?,
3366,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Yes I am interested how good is the bass response on theses subs?,
3367,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,"The Bass response is excellent, some of the best I've heard",
3368,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,I'm looking for something with a punch but I don't want it to shake my car apart or blow up my trunk.,
3369,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,I think these would work well for you,
3370,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Does it come with all the standard installation parts?,
3371,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,"They are new, still sealed in the box",
3372,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Ok I can personally pick these subs up today with 152 in cash would that be an offer you are interested in?,
3373,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,"No, I couldn't go that low.",
3374,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Then is there anything you could offer to sweeten the deal a little?,
3375,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,I could assist in installation,
3376,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,No im pretty adept at installation do you happen to have any dynamatt or other sound insulation material?,
3377,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,I do have a roughly 3x3 piece of dynamatt that I could throw in,
3378,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,ok that could push me to 172?,
3379,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,I would be willing to go to 180,
3380,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Could you meet me halfway for that price?,
3381,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,1,"yes, I could do that",
3382,C_bd10a625350049c18e7a4978e85b566d,0,Great then 180 it is then.,
3383,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Hey would you like to purchase my bike,
3384,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,"Hi there. Yes, I am very much interested in it. Is it very old?",
3385,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,No only 3 years,
3386,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,Wow that's a long time. May I ask why didn't you use it? Does it work well or are there any malfunctions associated?,
3387,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Well I love the bike but I had been riding cross country on an endurance bike. So this has been fairly unused. No malfunctions I had made sure to periodically spray it with anti rust and anti seeze. Also it was left in a dry and secure environment.,
3388,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,"Okay that's good ti know. However, the price is very high for me. Is there anyway that we can work on that?",
3389,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Yes but Id prefer to not go too low as I said before I love the bike and I am reluctuant to sell. Mainly selling due to me down sizing and lack of use.,
3390,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,I can offer $390 as its old and has been sitting. Would appreciate it if you consider it,
3391,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,390 is a bit harsh on me. Tell you what I can add a free delivery and a standard set of maintenace equipment specific to this type of bike,
3392,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,What's the last price you can give me?,
3393,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,lets start at 550 and negotiate in increments of 10 from there?,
3394,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,"I can give you $500 honestly, I can't go beyond that because It doesn't fit my budget after that. ]",
3395,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Ok 500 I can do and Ill also add a 1 year waranty on the chain to prove how sure I am of this bike.,
3396,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,That's absolutely great! Thanks then we got a deal!,
3433,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,0,Hello,

3436,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,1,Yes mechanically it is perfect. All rust has been dealt with. Also most of the interior has been corrected,
3437,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,0,Would you be willing to accept $14260?,
3438,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,1,That is a little too steep of a drop this was initially my grandfathers project but he unfortunately passed on. Now we are selling it with hopes of also supplementing the costs for his ceremony,
3439,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,0,$15000?,
3440,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,1,That would be reasonable. Would you be willing to pick up?,
3441,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,0,Sure,
3442,C_aefa6deff6bf4aefaf37b8dd4af251d8,1,Great you have a deal,

3445,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,0,"That's good to know. Before that, the listing mentions its from IKEA. Does it have any scratches or marks? since its black in color and I am buying it for my new house. So, I would like it to look like new and not used.",
3446,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,"It does have some minor scratches. Not too noticeable unless you look really, really closely. For that, I'm willing to bring the price down a bit.",

4016,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,I am! This looks like it has everything I need. Is the cable included in the price?,
4017,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Unfortunately not the wording is possibly slightly misleading our apartments are cable ready meaning once you contact one of the local cable companies and negotiate a package it is very simple for them to setup. We do have a contract with xfinity for a flat $50 basic HD package not included in rent.,
4018,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Oh well that is still a pretty good deal. The swimming pool and saunas are included in the rent though?,
4019,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Certainly those are included ammenities of our community that every resident has access too at the designated times. You may also purchase a pool key for $15 dollars however we ask that you please leave the pool by 11pm,
4020,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Then just one last question. Can you have a washer and dryer in your apartment?,
4021,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Yes you are more than welcome to use your own or rent a pair from us for no more than $25 extra in rent. However do note if you do use your own you would be held responsible from any damages that may occur due to an unfortunate malfunction.,
4022,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,All sounds good to me. I would like to pay 1350,
4023,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,1,Unfortunately that is not acceptable for our community. I can do 1800 while also throwing in a free pool key,
4024,C_dbeddfb85b414e14a07d336cbc02f7b9,0,Okay I'll take that.,

4336,C_d738af4b06584e74a7ac5f21db5a1a1c,1,"Honestly, the whole thing is pretty damaged from the looks of it, it would be just as cheap and faster to get one that is already refurbished.",

5258,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,ok.  will you be able to afford $1998 per person per month?,
5259,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,0,"Honestly that amount is a lot more than I'm comfortable with, since I'm on student loans. But since you're willing to change up the lease terms regarding move-in and move-out date, I can be a little flexible. Could you do $7000 from all four of us, per month?",
5260,C_d8887513df8b4238b0c478d829fdb43a,1,I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process.,

5575,C_01e68ec46d114f53bdf6943d429cbb5e,0,"So, it should work on any network that requires a SIM card, then, correct?  T-mobile for example?",
5576,C_01e68ec46d114f53bdf6943d429cbb5e,1,Yes that is correct. I am selling it at 397 but am willing to negotiate price,
5577,C_01e68ec46d114f53bdf6943d429cbb5e,0,"OK, it appears that the face is scratch-free and crack-free, is that correct?  How is the back?",

5579,C_01e68ec46d114f53bdf6943d429cbb5e,0,"Very nice.  I'm wondering if I might be able to pick it up directly from you, rather than having it shipped?",

5620,C_5306040252da44929f9e8a2c0c63b818,0,"Hmm, still kind of high. How about $2900?",

Manager is willing to waive your application fee and take ten dollars off your monthly rent with the first month free meaning you'll only have to pay 936 per month I swear this never happens and I have no idea what's gotten into him.,
5774,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"While that is a great deal, is there anyway he would go to $800 a month with all the above terms. I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.",
5775,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off. I think with his current mood  i could get him to 926 and throw in a key to the gym,
5776,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,Do you think that you could talk him into $850?,

5782,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?",

6590,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,How does 5500 sound? That is within my budget.,
6591,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,1,It sounds way too low.  If you come up some more I'm sure we can meet in the middle somewhere.,
6592,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,How about 8000? That seems like a good meeting point for us.,
6593,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,1,I think we can meet more at 9000.  I just put 4 new tires on it.,
6594,C_e034ee63e06a4a84bfe9576762d398e7,0,8700 and not a penny higher. How does that sound to you?,

6702,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,Can you tell me about the apartment? 2450 seems quite a bit above the going rate in that neighboorhood. I was looking for closer to 1225,
6703,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,this is completely remodeled.  It is like new,
6704,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,"the pictures look great, but it still seems a bit pricey compared to other apartments in the area. I can do 1600, just because I like that building",
6705,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,i can go 2200 a month,
6706,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,"ummm. I don't know, it doesn't even have a washer/dryer. I would have to share with the neighbor. I could go up to 1900 if you put in a washer/dryer",
6707,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,2100 and the washer and dryer are yours,
6708,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,That is still way too high for the area. I'm pretty firm on the 1900. I have a great history as a renter with lots of referneces. I won't trash your place and pay my rent on time.,
6709,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,"ok, 2000",
6710,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,How about 1950 and the washer and dryer. I think we could both be happy with that.,

7113,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,"That is too low for an unlocked phone in great condition.  I can lower the price to $300, but that is the best I can do.  I need the money from this phone to buy some other things.",
7114,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,I see it is has some condition issues  and it is used  not to mention on the smaller side as far as memory goes,
7115,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,The issue is cosmetic.  I can bring the price down to $275 if that bothers so.  I can also throw in a free headset.  Deal?,
7116,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,i can do 150 thats pretty much the best i can do  275 is still to much,
7117,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,I cannot sell it that low.  Do you have anything else you can give me plus the money to see if we can make a deal?,
7118,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,i can send you an older fitbit  and bring the cash offer up to 175  that is my best and final,
7119,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,If you can pay $200.  I will take the cash and fitbit.  I will still give you the headset for free.  Deal?,
7120,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,I can do 190 and the fitbit you include the headset  and we have a deal,

7170,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,0,Are you open to negotiation on the Altima?,
7171,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,1,"Yes, I am. It is a great car and very well maintained. I can get you service records if needed",
7172,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,0,"That all sounds great, but unfortunately I just lost my job. I can't pay full price for a car, but I do really need one to get to interviews to try to get a new job.",
7173,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,1,That is an unfortunate situation. What are you able to do?,
7174,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,0,"I know it's kind of low, but would you be able to take $4000, considering my situation?",
7175,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,1,"I'd love to help you out, but I can't go that low. How about 6000",
7176,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,0,6000 is unfortunately still too high for me. Could we meet in the middle at 5000?,
7177,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,1,"Man I'd love to, but that's cutting a lot off of what I need out of this. How about 5500",
7178,C_d791c2499509456296a08dd3adae6070,0,$5500 is acceptable. Thanks!,
7210,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,Whoa ! You have 17 years of experience?,
7211,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,"Yes, I have been doing this a long time. I really take great pride in my craftsmanship when making a bike.",
7212,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,Nice ! It's not for me it's for my boyfriend.,
7213,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,"He will really like it, it is a very stylish bike with great features and a sturdy frame.",
7214,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,"I can see, I like it cause it's his size. He's so small, I'm 6'5"" and he's 5'5"" LOL",
7215,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,"It will fit him well, does he add any special equipment to the bike?",
7216,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,"I. Have. No. Idea. But, I do know he like Schwinn stuff.",
7217,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,"Perfect, the bike is priced at $350; are you in the local area?",
7218,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,"Yeah, I was going to pick it up and surprise him. So you need to do everything to it that it needs before I give it to him, I'll give you extra!",
7219,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,"I have already tuned the bike to be in ready-to-ride condition. There is no reason to pay any extra. $350 is fine, but I do not have a credit card machine so it would need to be cash or money order.",
7220,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,"What, I'm gay, I roll in cash honey. Well, I wanted to pay $175 cause that is what I could just get some bike for, but you do have skills and if you make sure it's super clean, I'll pay you more. Can you polish it up and oil it, or whatever it is you do to bikes.",
7221,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,This is a bike that will make him very happy. No reason to pay any extra just the $350. I will polish it very nice and all the gears are completely oiled with a 3 in 1 oil. This will ensure no corrision on the chain and the spokes. It also ensures the chain stays completely linked to the drive spoke.,
7222,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,0,"Riiiiight... that does not mean anything to me, honey your wasting your time with all that shop talk. Like I said, I was going to pay $175 for another bike but I'm willing to pay more for your time so what is it like an hour to tune it up real clean and stuff? How about $75 per hour. I'll give you $175 plus another $75, like $275?",
7223,C_6e1bf50b12224279bfcf23eea76bed82,1,$275 works for me.,

7326,C_a6723a00e4504124928a3c39c1d123aa,1,"I would like 13,500 for it. But I am willing to negotiate on that but can't come down too much.",
7327,C_a6723a00e4504124928a3c39c1d123aa,0,"Well, it says on the ad it has 100k miles on it.  It's a nice car but that's quite a bit, honestly.  And it's already 6 years old",
7328,C_a6723a00e4504124928a3c39c1d123aa,1,"That is the dealership maintenance package which is good up to 100,000 miles. The car only has 34,000 miles on it and is a BMW i series.",
7329,C_a6723a00e4504124928a3c39c1d123aa,0,"Oh, I see I need to work on my reading comprehension.  Well, I only have 10000 right now",
7330,C_a6723a00e4504124928a3c39c1d123aa,1,"The Kelley Blue Book value is 16,500 so I would need at least 12,000 and I can give you a month to come up with that.",

7440,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Yes I am interested but could you tell me what condition is it in?,
7441,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,Are you interested in purchasing this item,
7442,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Yes. What condition is it in though?,
7443,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,it is in great condition.,
7444,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,Why are you selling it?,
7445,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,We've had some financial troubles this year. Just trying to make ends meet.,
7446,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,"Okay would you take $2,000 for it? sounds like you really need the money",
7447,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,1,"Unfortunately I can't go that low, I'm think more in the $3500 range. As you can see from the ad, this bike has a great deal of upgrades and customization. It's really a steal at this price",
7448,C_dfa635b9f9994e06b6ec74e2e388be84,0,"Upgrades and customization don't really add value to something if you're selling it to someone else. I'll give you $2,100",
7460,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,"Hello, I'm interested in your rental property.",
7461,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Great it is 1595 a month with a security deposit equal to 1 month rent unless of course your have great or really damaged credit.,
7462,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,That sounds like a great deal but the best I can comfortable afford is $1350.,
7463,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Well as I am just an agent for the owner I do not have all that much wiggle room but if you would be willing to sign a lease for longer then one year I may be able to help you out a bit.  Is that something that you would consider?,
7464,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,A lease for a year doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. I could push for $1480. Is that something you can agree too?,
7465,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,"In order for me to go down to 1480 I would need you to sign a 2 year lease.  Keep in mind that this does include lawn maintenance as well as hoa fees.  There is also a pool, club house and rec center that you will have access to as a member of this community.",
7466,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,Hmm... those sound like nice things to have. However I'm not too sure if I should sign a 2 year lease. What range are you looking for in order for me to sign a 1 year lease?,
7467,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Well the owner does not want us to go any lower on a 1 year lease but let me ask how is your credit?  The reason that I ask is because if you have a score over 700 I can waive the security deposit.,
7468,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,0,"I would say my credit is fairly good. I'm also starting to think that a 2 year lease isn't really a bad idea. Oh, alright! I'll take the risk! I could make some good friend along the way too. So are you still willing to accept $1480 is I sign a 2 year lease?",
7469,C_62883839805e45b3918ef93608a85d84,1,Yes that is correct.,

7475,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,1,Well it is listed for about $250.,
7476,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,0,"That's a bit steep for me, and it is used after all. Would you take $100?",
7477,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,1,Do you think you could go up to $175?,
7478,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,0,That's a little more than I would be willing to spend. How does $140 sound?,
7479,C_f1f44b6fd3c74886be7bac4f69571ec3,1,"$140, and I will drop it off next week.",

7522,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,1,Close to many shopping centers and all top end appliances are included. There is even a wine fridge in the kitchen. Washer an Dryer is front loading and only 6 months old,
7523,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,"My only issue is the area it's in has a high crime rate, can you come down on the price?",

7525,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,I still see prices much lower than that in the area and the crime rate hasn't gone down all that much. I just checked yesterday. Can you do 1000?,
7526,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,1,"Not at all. There are far too many upgrades to let it go for that little. My Rock bottom is $1950. I put a lot of money into the granite counters, p graded fixtures and the tile in the condo.",
7527,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,"1500 and I'll even sign a longer lease, I know that's worth something.",
7528,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,1,$1750 and a 24 month lease that's really all I can do.,
7529,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,"1600 and the same terms and we have a deal. I am a great tenant as well, cleanest background check you'll ever see.",
7530,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,1,I'm sorry that is just too low. I will not make up the difference even with your 24 month lease. I'm sorry we couldn't come to an understanding. $1750 is final offer,

7577,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,"I do, it's about the price. I like the location of this apartment very much, but the price is ridiculous. The post says there is a $500 off special. I'm curious, is that deducted from the price you listed the apartment at?",
7578,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,It would be on the price we both agree upon.,
7579,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,"So then with the $500 off, how does $700 sound all together?",

7581,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,Then can we work out a deal close to that? I can assure you that I can pay rent on time.,
7582,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,The lowest I'm authorized to go is 900. And that would be the flat monthly rent. The first month's rent would be 400 with the deduction.,
7583,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,"If I give you 900, could we settle free parking for my first month as well?",
7584,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,Yes that can be done. So overall you'll be saving quite a lot. So 900 is good for you?,

7732,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,0,I see you are asking for a year lease.  Are the utilities covered in this price?,

7734,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,0,I'm interested in signing a lease but I just started a new job so my budget is tight.  What is the least you would accept for this beautiful place?,
7735,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,1,"I completely understand!  If you are truly interested and can sign a lease within the next week, the lowest I can go is $2600.",
7736,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,0,That's still more than I wanted to pay for a place.  I can sign asap. Can you do $2300?,
7737,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,1,$2300 is much lower than I can accept.  How about $2500?,
7738,C_76565962987f41a7adc0b3dcbc21c028,0,It will be a strain but I think I can do $2500,

7807,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Perfect!  I do have to admit, I am a little concerned by the additional work though.  While it's appealing, I'm concerned about how it might affect the reliability.",
7808,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,I can guarantee that I have driven this car for about a year now and haven't had a single issue with it- the car runs perfectly and I have not had to conduct any repairs.,
7809,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Ok, that's good.  I feel that 45,000 is a bit high though.  Of course, I do understand that it is a 2016 and has industry standard mileage.  Would you consider coming down on the price some?",
7810,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,"The lowest I'm willing to drop it is 42,500. I've done some serious work to this car.",

7812,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,"38,000 just seems too low to me. I could do 41000 as long as you pay in cash, as well as picking up the car and taking care of all the paperwork yourself",

7896,C_bf2b51e9f8664ac1a727b94dc0593f23,0,How about 2100?,
7897,C_bf2b51e9f8664ac1a727b94dc0593f23,1,2100 is far too low. How about 2400?,
7898,C_bf2b51e9f8664ac1a727b94dc0593f23,0,You have to admit the mileage is really high. I'll pay 2150 if you deliver it.,

8332,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,hi there. I am interested in this apartment. I have been looking for one for months now and this one caught my attention. Is the location good?,
8333,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,The location is great,
8334,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,The price doesn't work for me. I am willing to pay about $1540 would it work for you?,
8335,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,That is a substantial amount lower than we are able to go.  The best we could knock off would be around 10%.,
8336,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,0,What's the final price?,
8337,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,$1980 would be the lowest we can go.  Would you be willing to sign an extended lease at that rate?,

8341,C_ace5d307f64e4f3f8100f6c94727c466,1,Would 1600 a month be doable and then 30 hours a month of caretaking duties (which equates to $20 an hour),

12252,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",
12253,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Oh my.  That's lower than I anticipated.  How about $900?  Would that work?  I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,
12254,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",
12255,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you.  How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",
12256,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",
12257,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal.",
12258,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",
12259,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Sounds Great!,
12303,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"Hi, are you interested in the iphone?",
12304,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,0,Hi I am interested in your iphone. I understand its still in the box? can I use it with any carrier?,
12305,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"Yes, you just have to move over the SIM card from your old phone. It is basically what you would get as a new phone from your carrier, but at a much lower cost",
12306,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,0,If there is something wrong with it can I return it?,
12307,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"Yes, I would be willing to give you 30 days to return it if that would be okay",
12308,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,0,Ok that is fair. I would like to offer $550 for ti.,
12309,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,I can't go that low because I would be losing money. I could come down to $780,
12310,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,0,I understand. I am low on funds right now but I could come up a little. how about $650,
12311,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"I am giving you the option to return it, so I would be taking some risk myself, how about we meet in the middle at 710",
12312,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,0,Ok that seems fair. I can do $710 and I can come and pick it up,
12313,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"okay, sounds good! Thank you!",

12427,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,1,What price are you thinking?,
12428,C_2ca7fec7200846af84fe4200614eee9d,0,I was thinking $30,

13150,C_8ed7f8f4312d49e4b378de473c618b88,1,"Great. Would you like to stop by and take a look at it? This apartment is located in a very nice area and it has all of the major conveniences. It has a microwave, an air conditioner and a dishwasher.",

13224,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,"Hello, I'm inquiring about the phone you're selling.",
13225,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,1,Yes Hi. What do you want to know?,
13226,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,Is the phone in good condition? Any scratches?,
13227,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,1,The phone is in great condition. I had it with a case the whole time.,
13228,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,Which provider did you have service with?,
13229,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,1,I had it with ATT but made sure they unlock it so it can be used with any provider,
13230,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,I really need a phone right now but I am only willing to offer $130. Would you be willing to sell it for that price?,
13231,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,1,No way. This is practically new phone. I forgot to mention it comes with a warranty so I can lower it to $270,
13232,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,I am limited on funds. I only have so much to spend. I wish I had more. How about $180?,
13233,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,1,Sorry this phone is like new. I am willing to give you a set of headphones with it and sell it for $265. Thats the lowest I can do,
13234,C_fddd5b43ff9d4cb99dc1f0e5c77627d9,0,OK. It's a sacrifice but I'll be willing to pay that.,
13235,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Hello how are you today?,
13236,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"Hello, I am doing great. How are you? I am interested in the apartment on Bassett Dr. Is it still available?",
13237,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Yes it sure it.,
13238,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,Has it been remodeled recently? Is it close to shops?,
13239,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,"Yes we actually just remodeled it this past month so everything is brand new.  The location is perfect, it is a quiet residential neighboorhood but you are just a 5 minute walk from many local shops.",
13240,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,Would you be willing to come down on the price at all? Would you take $800?,
13241,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half.  What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.,
13242,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,
13243,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Well that is a possibility.  What are your qualifications?,
13244,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"I have 10+ years of experience in building maintenance, carpentry and electrical work. I also have references.",
13245,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Ok that sounds good.  These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095.  Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.,
13246,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"That sounds great, Thank you.",
13247,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,0,hello,

13252,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,1,Drop it off?  I am not sure about that,
13253,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,0,"ok, i can pick it up  if the price is somewhat negotiable",
13254,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,1,The price is a fantastic $18-,
13255,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,0,i have 162 cash right now,
13256,C_cd71e24866f345f1a80e63885b2ab97e,1,"$162, is $175 fine?",

13272,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,1,Ok. I was thinking $150. It's a pretty nice receiver.,
13273,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,0,Will you tell me a little about it?,
13274,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,1,"80 watts per channel, with surround sound output. Very low harmonic distortion. Great for a home theater.",
13275,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,0,"That sounds good, but can we go down to around $80?",
13276,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,1,That's a bit too low. I can do 110 though.,
13277,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,0,I don't think I can go above $95.,
13278,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,1,"OK, I'll do $95.",
13279,C_2cf6b861bae649d0b00ed220760aeb70,0,Sounds good thanks.,
13498,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,"What a lovely house! I wonder, how high up is it? I'm afraid of heights.",
13499,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,"Hello, thank you! It is on the side of a hill. The hill is not steep. It is completely safe and secured with a fence around it.",
13500,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,Oh that's not so bad then. I see you have an updated kitchen and bathrooms? Did you use tile and what does the color scheme look like?,
13501,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,We've had a decorator come and in and it has a very modern feel to it. The kitchen and bathrooms have been updated. The backyard is enclosed for privacy. I am asking $4995.,
13502,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,"That is my only concern, it's a little high. I am contractor, I could keep the grounds in order for you if you can come down to...$4200?",
13503,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,"If you are offering to tend to the grounds, there is not much of it, I could come down to $4500",
13504,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,"I'm sure you have other properties where I can help out, $4300?",
13505,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,"That is the only property I have at the moment. Because of all the upgrades I have done, I am already giving you a great deal by bringing it down to $4500",
13506,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,"I'm sorry, but I can't squeeze blood from a stone. $4350 is the absolute most I can afford.",
13507,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,I can do $4450 if you can move in by the first with a deposit.,
13508,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,Can I sublet a bedroom and rent my space?,
13509,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,1,"Yes, you may.",
13510,C_1cde3ba5c42045639d33acc1cfb27aae,0,"$4450, yeah I can come up with that. You have a deal.",
13543,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,1,Hey there,
13544,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,0,"Hello, I see you have a Tacoma for sale?",
13545,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,1,"Yes it is a great truck with only 60,000 miles.",
13546,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,0,"Thats not bad at all, what's your asking price?",
13547,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,1,"Asking $11,500.",
13548,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,0,According to Kelly Blue Book that would be a fair price if it wasn't involved in an accident two years ago. I pulled the Carfax. It's worth a whole lot less now. How about $5000?,
13549,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,1,That is way too low. The accident only broke the rear tail light when the dirt biker came out of the woods and clipped my tail light.  I can do $8000 or $6000 if you have something else offer in trade?,
13550,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,0,Well I do have a really nice kayak that I've only used three times. I could give that to you with the paddles and we can do $6000?,
13551,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,1,Perfect.  It's a deal.,
13552,C_472890670a47428f9d0bd9d11b952a0c,0,Sounds great!,

13577,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,1,"Sure..  It is a 2005 with 99k miles on it.  Timing belt and water pump has been replaced and all oil changes and such have been maintained.  Does have some clear coats peeling, but not horribly bad.  Comes from a smoke free home.",
13578,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,0,"I'm looking for a vehicle for my daughter to take to college with her, in Washington state. Has the car been reliable? How's the gas mileage?",
13579,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,1,It has been a good reliable vehicle.  Gets about 25 in town and 28 highways.,
13580,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,0,Awesome! How's the interior - any torn upholstery or cracks in the dash?,

13585,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,1,That is too low.  I would like to get at at least $5000..,
13586,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,0,I was hoping to also provide her with a years paid insurance. I can go up to $4000.,
13587,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,1,That is understandable.  Could u do $4200..,
13588,C_83735b1dbb7a481d8acc27bb07e4d896,0,How about $4100?,

13637,C_e40a2a9ed1be450dbf1c70494687dbb6,1,"Hello, it has 20040 miles. Its in perfect condition!",
13638,C_e40a2a9ed1be450dbf1c70494687dbb6,0,It only has 20k miles?,
13639,C_e40a2a9ed1be450dbf1c70494687dbb6,1,"Yes, I only use it on certain occasions since I use my other car daily",
13640,C_e40a2a9ed1be450dbf1c70494687dbb6,0,"That's great, how is the shape of the interior?",
13641,C_e40a2a9ed1be450dbf1c70494687dbb6,1,"Its very clean interior, no scratches or tears on the fabric",

13658,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,Hi there.,
13659,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,Howdy! Are you interested in the speaker set?,
13660,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,I am good.  And yes I am.,
13661,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,Excellent! What questions do you have about what's listed here?,
13662,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,Are you the original owner?  What is the condition?  How old is it?,
13663,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,I am the original owner. I've had it for quite some time so it's certainly had its use. There are some very minor cosmetic flaws but the sound quality and functionality is 100%! I don't recall the original manufactured date of this specific model but I can tell it was engineered to last.,
13664,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,Awesome.  I want it.  I could come and pick it up today.  I have $28 cash in hand.,
13665,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,"I appreciate that offer but I really need to get at least $35 out of it. I'd be happy to include the deck stand with it all. After all, it looks good with the rest of the set.",
13666,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,0,Right now I can only do $32.  Would that work??,
13667,C_e585495d089643b79dcd35028ace3356,1,"Well, considering I've had the listing for awhile, I'm also ready to get this thing to a new home so that we can move. That will work!",
14021,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Hello! I see you're interested in the car I have for sale.,
14022,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Yes, I am.  Can you offer a few more details about it?",
14023,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"Sure! It's a 2006 Toyota Avalon with 155,000 miles on it. It comes with leather seats, sun roof, navigation system. The AC and heat work well. Tires and breaks were just checked and in great condition.",
14024,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Awesome, those were a few of the details I was interested in.  How much estimated wear do you think the tires may have?",
14025,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"I just put new tires on last year, and have put about 12,000 miles on them since then. They are 60,000 mile tires, so I'd say you'll get a good 3-4 years before having to replace, depending on your use.",
14026,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Great, that is good to know.  Is this a one owner vehicle?",
14027,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Yes. I purchased this new.,
14028,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Are the miles on it mainly highway miles, or has this just been an all around vehicle for you?",
14029,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"I do have a commute of about 25 miles one way, so yes, most are highway miles, but some around town as well. Toyotas run forever, if taken care of and I've only have to replace tires and do oil changes so far!",
14030,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Would you like to come and see the car?,
14031,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"What about the paint job, how is the outside condtion?",
14032,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,It is very clean inside and out!,
14033,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Cool.  It seems to be a nice car, however the price you are asking is a little high compared to what is showing on Kelly BB.  Are you open for offers?",
14034,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,I am.,
14035,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"WEll without offending you, the Kelly BB value only shows a value of 3500 based on it being in excellent condition.  Would you be willing to consider an offer of about 3250?",
14036,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"No sorry, that's a bit too low. I actually took this to a dealer who was going to offer me much more than that. I could come down to $5500.",
14037,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,Hmmm...that is surprising based on the Kelly BB value.  I do not think I could go that high.  How about 4000 cash today?,
14038,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Lowest I can possible go would be $5200.,
14039,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Sorry, I just cant go that high but thank you.",

14056,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,0,"That's so cool I never heard of any clock like this.  I was hoping you would be able to come down on the price a little bit though, maybe I could trade you an item to make it more fair?",

14261,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,0,That is great. Do you have any units for thos with lower income? The price is a bit high for my budget,
14262,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,1,"I can drop the price a little bit for you, could you pay 2500 and then for the first month I can writeoff your payment?",
14263,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,0,That would be a great deal but still high long term. Could you do $1900 monthly?,

15813,C_f9b44417713b41dd8e74ac03b543ec21,1,No accidents.,
15814,C_f9b44417713b41dd8e74ac03b543ec21,0,I think i'm interested.  Would you consider 4000?,
15815,C_f9b44417713b41dd8e74ac03b543ec21,1,Would you be willing to do $5000?,
15816,C_f9b44417713b41dd8e74ac03b543ec21,0,Would you throw in a 90 day warranty?,

15819,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,Hello I was interested in your studio apartment. Could you tell me a bit more about it?,
15820,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,1,HI!  How are you?,
15821,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,I am doing well Thanks.,
15822,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,1,Yes this studio is very stylish.  It has hardwood throughout.  It's very spacious and modern.,
15823,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,Is it true there was a murder at this location? Would you be willing to go lower?,
15824,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,1,As far as I know it isn't true but I have done extensive research on that subject.  We are asking $2025 for it.,
15825,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,Does it need any work to it? Perhaps I could give a hand with maintenance tasks and painting and the such if you give me half off. Say $1012?,
15826,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,1,We may need some things done and could possibly use your help.  How about 1500?,
15827,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,Could we call it $1250 and ill supply my own tools and supplies as needed?,
15828,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,1,Ok sounds great!,
15829,C_f1b766dd3ef3426daa67c9759477bbae,0,"Great, I will see you soon to sign this lease!",
15899,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,Hello! Are you interested in my wonderful land rover?,
15900,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Possibly! It looks promising from what you've listed there -- but I note that it is pretty old. A 2001 model. What kind of mileage are we talking about?,
15901,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,It has 230000 miles. It is a bit old but it has a clean title and passed the smog recently. Also no scratches or dents!,
15902,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,Sounds roughly par for the course. What's shaken loose after all those miles? Have there been any major repairs?,
15903,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The only thing wrong with it is a cracked windshield. Other than that tires are great and it runs amazing,
15904,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"So, being a 2001 model -- what can you tell me about its car seat compatibility?",
15905,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,It has all the belt attachments on the back for car seats. We used it with all my kids and never had problems,
15906,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"Now. It does sound like it's a solid hunk of metal -- but the age of the thing does give me pause when I consider I'm going to be putting my kids into it. It's not failed yet, but I can't help but wonder when the other shoe will drop.",
15907,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,1,The older the better! Now days all new cars are made with cheap metal that gets destroyed easily in if you crash. How about we settle for 2800?,
15908,C_b7820b507c2e46e0bf86dd3d218ea6c2,0,"Okay, good point. 2500 and we've got a deal.",

15917,C_f302bd55a31d4015adc7c5af55f4556c,0,I don't have much to spend on it. How about 460. Thats as high as I can go,
15918,C_f302bd55a31d4015adc7c5af55f4556c,1,I really can't go that low...this brand new item would be 2x the amount that I am asking for it...how about $650 and it's yours,

16032,C_4e122f252afa4c399013d83ccbea3942,0,I was curious what condition this is in? Does it come from a smoke free pet free home?,
16033,C_4e122f252afa4c399013d83ccbea3942,1,"Yes it is new. It was in our showroom, and we need to make some room. It comes with the pillows shown in the picture as well.",

16035,C_4e122f252afa4c399013d83ccbea3942,1,"No, these are popular and we have no problem selling them. I've dropped the price to $1000 because of a sale.",
16036,C_4e122f252afa4c399013d83ccbea3942,0,Are you firm at $1000 then?,
16037,C_4e122f252afa4c399013d83ccbea3942,1,"If you need a deal, I can give it you for $900, but you have to come pick it up yourself",

16104,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"I've had it a year or so. We got another one and although we could still use this, we don't need two.",

16106,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion. You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,

16108,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand. I'm asking $949 which is below market.,
16109,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",
16110,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Oh my. That's lower than I anticipated. How about $900? Would that work? I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,
16111,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",
16112,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you. How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",
16113,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",

16198,C_c5d27473be6349c4a5bbb34b302bebb8,1,"Yes, you just have to move over the SIM card from your old phone. It is basically what you would get as a new phone from your carrier, but at a much lower cost",

18401,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,1,hello I have an amazing house to sell at a very reasonable price,
18402,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,0,"quite a home you got there. yes, i would like to rent this",
18403,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,1,so glad to hear that! What do you think of all the amenities it comes with?,
18404,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,0,They are adequate. The outside looks good.,
18405,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,1,Yea it's a great place to live. 3000 in this area so close to the freeways and so many stores is a great deal. I know it's going to rent quickly.,
18406,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,0,A lovely home but I was hoping you could go down a bit. I was thinking 2700.,
18407,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,1,totally understandable. I am open to making a deal for this property but I think 2700 is lower than what I could get from someone else. I like you though so let's make a deal we are both happy with. I could go to 2900,
18408,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,0,Well i appreciate that you are willing to work with me. I will settle for that fair price. 2900 will work.,
18409,C_6934230459dc43e7878414e0c716daa3,1,i submitted 2900,
18620,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Hello! I see you're interested in the car I have for sale.,
18621,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Yes, I am. Can you offer a few more details about it?",
18622,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"Sure! It's a 2006 Toyota Avalon with 155,000 miles on it. It comes with leather seats, sun roof, navigation system. The AC and heat work well. Tires and breaks were just checked and in great condition.",
18623,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Awesome, those were a few of the details I was interested in. How much estimated wear do you think the tires may have?",
18624,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"I just put new tires on last year, and have put about 12,000 miles on them since then. They are 60,000 mile tires, so I'd say you'll get a good 3-4 years before having to replace, depending on your use.",
18625,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Great, that is good to know. Is this a one owner vehicle?",
18626,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Yes. I purchased this new.,
18627,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Are the miles on it mainly highway miles, or has this just been an all around vehicle for you?",
18628,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"I do have a commute of about 25 miles one way, so yes, most are highway miles, but some around town as well. Toyotas run forever, if taken care of and I've only have to replace tires and do oil changes so far!",
18629,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Would you like to come and see the car?,
18630,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"What about the paint job, how is the outside condtion?",
18631,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,It is very clean inside and out!,
18632,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Cool. It seems to be a nice car, however the price you are asking is a little high compared to what is showing on Kelly BB. Are you open for offers?",
18633,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,I am.,
18634,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"WEll without offending you, the Kelly BB value only shows a value of 3500 based on it being in excellent condition. Would you be willing to consider an offer of about 3250?",
18635,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"No sorry, that's a bit too low. I actually took this to a dealer who was going to offer me much more than that. I could come down to $5500.",
18636,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,Hmmm...that is surprising based on the Kelly BB value. I do not think I could go that high. How about 4000 cash today?,
18637,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,Lowest I can possible go would be $5200.,
18638,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,0,"Sorry, I just cant go that high but thank you.",
18639,C_ca9db1d5c69f42f580b0dcad33eec7ac,1,"Okay, thanks for your interest!",

18654,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,1,It was a graduation present from a quirky uncle. It is really nice and I'd keep it but I have no room for it and since I'm moving I really need to find it a new home.,
18655,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,0,"That's so cool I never heard of any clock like this. I was hoping you would be able to come down on the price a little bit though, maybe I could trade you an item to make it more fair?",
18656,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,1,I can't really take any trades but I am VERY flexible on the price.,
18657,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,0,"Oh sweet well I was hoping to pay more like 375 to suit my budget but I'm sure that's very low for you, would you make me your best offer?",
18658,C_e9b9d671cd3b4974a0e86731cddb7e4d,1,$500 is the lowest I can accept at this time.,

18829,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,There wasn't really one specific thing. She just enjoys the bed we have now. It is in excellent condition and comes from a smoke and pet free home.,
18830,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,How many times was the bed used?,
18831,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"We basically took ours off and put this on, but she decided after a nights sleep on it, that she preferred ours better.",
18832,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Is it the latest model?,

18834,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,
18835,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"I just want it out of here. I figured if I asked more than that, that it wouldn't sell quickly. I don't have the space to continue to store it and I will deliver for free..",

18932,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,0,That is great. Do you have any units for thos with lower income? The price is a bit high for my budget,
18933,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,1,"I can drop the price a little bit for you, could you pay 2500 and then for the first month I can writeoff your payment?",
18934,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,0,That would be a great deal but still high long term. Could you do $1900 monthly?,

I can include your utilities also if you are able to come by this week and for you I can take another 100 from your rent but that is probably the lowest I can go. Will 2400 work for you?",
18936,C_e58255b2768b4e22b5022cdafac7896e,0,I will make it work. 2400 is fine,

18957,C_d84960f317754212a59104b0c36c7264,0,I don't know. That phone has reports of a lot of glitches. You might have a hard time unloading it. Would you take 40?,
18958,C_d84960f317754212a59104b0c36c7264,1,I could come down to $60. I bought it because it had great reviews! Hadn't heard about the glitches though.,
