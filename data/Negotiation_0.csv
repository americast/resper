38,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,"Hmm ok. It says it`s like new, but 2 years old could possibly warrant a slightly lower price? Are you open for negotiation?",

40,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,0,The highest I can offer is around 100 dollars. Is this too low?,
41,C_e2781ecd69264b00a4cc25ee96d271c5,1,Yes,

132,C_ce5ae3acf9934d278fa6fd626a5fbebf,1,"This is a quiet community normally. And yes, there was an incident recently.

133,C_ce5ae3acf9934d278fa6fd626a5fbebf,0,"Personally, I'd like to live near work, but the wife you know... I got a place lined up for 2,000 a month, so there's a very wide gap here between what you are asking.",

3274,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,Hi there,
3275,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,Is your sofa in good shape,
3276,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,It is used but in good condition,
3277,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,"Ok good, do you think it is better for sleeping or just relaxing?",
3278,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,You can use it as a sofa and convert it into a sleeper. I love it but I am moving to another state and I can't bring it with me,
3279,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,Oh ok.,
3280,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,I'm selling it for 40. nice price,
3281,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,Do you think you can go a little lower?,

3283,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,Yes.,
3284,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,How about 30?,
3285,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,0,That sounds good.,
3286,C_afe36afa463f419d8ad1fff85759e5d6,1,Great! I'll see you soom,
3343,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Woud you be willing to go lower?,
3344,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,I could go to 250.,
3345,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,But you see you already put the price in so we cant negotiate. For the future negotiate first then price or else we will get the hit rejected.,
3346,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,Oh sorry. I guess I misunderstood that part. I can help deliver it to you.,
3347,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,That is certainly appealing as I do not have the neccessary equipment to move the set. A uahul would probably run me an extra 300.,
3348,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,Probably. So for 275 I'll deliver it. Sound good?,
3349,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Yes but one thin how worn is the bed and base has it been used for any intense activities?,
3350,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,The bed is not worn more than normal for being used for 9 months. The frame is great and Tempur Pedic box springs are very reliable. Nothing intense has happened.,
3351,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,0,Good cause Id personally feel uncomfortable if any activities like when a mommy and daddy like each other very much took place on it. Ok Id be willing to accept your offer.,
3352,C_a7e41f175b6f4a53ab31daa0bb02de8b,1,"Nothing like that happened. Great, it's a deal.",
3464,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,0,Hi there. I was looking for ads and this one caught my attention. Is it in a good and working condition?,
3465,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,1,"It is, it's been used a lot less than its age would suggest. I only rode it a few times a month. Are you interested?",

3467,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,1,"What's your price point? It's clearly stylish, how does 950 sound?",
3468,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,0,That's way high for me. I have a budget of $760,
3469,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,1,"I'd already be giving you a discount if we went to 900, she's really a beauty",
3470,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,0,That doesn't fit into my budget at all.,
3471,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,1,875 then? I can't go down to 760.,
3472,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,0,Yeah that sounds like a fair deal.,
3473,C_86b749f3d83144c082a98451dc1cb1f7,1,Thank you,

3556,C_12e0540bfaba45608412198731e494b9,1,"No, that is too low. How about $225?",
3557,C_12e0540bfaba45608412198731e494b9,0,How about $125,
3558,C_12e0540bfaba45608412198731e494b9,1,I can't do that. How about $175?,
3559,C_12e0540bfaba45608412198731e494b9,0,If I pick it up today with cash would you do $140?,
3560,C_12e0540bfaba45608412198731e494b9,1,I suppose we could make that work.,

3951,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,1,Well I bought the bike from someone else and have not used it. He did not specify on the miles but just said that it was very low!,
3952,C_1e34a436f26e4a3f804f9fbc08f44614,0,"Hmm--the ad says that you bought it new. Since you actually bought it (lightly) used from someone else, can we lower the price to $450?",

4440,C_7627c88340864fa5a93b8f477cffa793,1,I can throw in a helmet and some knee pads. I also have riding gloves. They're pink if that's okay with you.,
4441,C_7627c88340864fa5a93b8f477cffa793,0,That would be great would you take $800 for everything?,
4442,C_7627c88340864fa5a93b8f477cffa793,1,That's really low for such a great bike. How about $1000?,
4443,C_7627c88340864fa5a93b8f477cffa793,0,Can we meet in the middle and say $900?,

4496,C_fd016d47a55845dcb134a8fc1f4a10ab,1,"I am wanting to do a quick deal, but that is far too low. I woudl need you to come much closer, like I said in great condition practically brand new.",
4497,C_fd016d47a55845dcb134a8fc1f4a10ab,0,I can't go much higher at the moment. How low will you go?,
4498,C_fd016d47a55845dcb134a8fc1f4a10ab,1,"I would say 900, I am taking a loss on it even at 1200.",

4530,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"Hello, I see you are selling a bike?",
4531,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,Yes I am.,
4532,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,How long have you had it?,
4533,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,"I had it for about a year but hardly used it, because my daughter outgrew very quickly, and it was for her actually.",
4534,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,Was it ever taken to the Mountains?,
4535,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,No only used it on the streets,
4536,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,That's a plus.  Did your daughter ever have an accident or fall off of the bike?,
4537,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,No thankfully she did not!,
4538,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"Excellent! If you don't mind me asking, how much did you originally pay for it?",
4539,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I had originally got it for $200 but I am now selling it for half the price,
4540,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"I see.  I like the bike. It seems like a good deal, but I am very hesitant to pay $100 for it when it is a year old.  Is there any wiggle room on that price?",
4541,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I could bring it down to $90 that's about it because its not very old.,
4542,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"$90 pretty good, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80.  Maybe we can meet in the middle at $85?",
4543,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,I can do $90 and that's about it,
4544,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,You drive a hard bargain.  Are you getting a lot of offers for it?,
4545,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,Yes I am. But I am willing to give it to you for $90. Are you interested?,
4546,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,0,"Since you did come down a bit, I guess I could tighten my belt at $90.",
4547,C_2a2307df6e2c4f48818a24dc8fe71ce6,1,Thank you!,
4560,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,0,Hi,

4564,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,0,"Great, do you know if they are all terrain tires?",
4565,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,1,Yes they are,
4566,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,0,"great, I am hoping we could make a deal.. I was thinking I can do a cash offer of 304",
4567,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,1,That's too less for me. I can give it to you for $350,
4568,C_1813c810c3744bf49a7591f035611797,0,If you can deliver it I can do 350.,

4599,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,"they never peed on it or anything, right?",
4600,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,No they have not. There is a small broken corner but you cannot tell when it is against the wall,
4601,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,Do you think you would be willing to bring down the price since it is somewhat damaged?,
4602,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,"Maybe a little, however It is fairly new so I would like to get close to what i paid for",
4603,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,"well a used product can rarely fetch the price paid, I was thinking  $59 and I can come pick it up myself.",
4604,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,I would consider $75,
4605,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,I feel that is too much since it is damaged already and have to try to repaint and repair it.,
4606,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,The paint is very fresh and does not need a new coat. The price I paid last year was $300 so you are getting it for less than 1/3,
4607,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,"I need to paint it if there is a chip, either I can do 60 cash and come get it, or I will have to pass.",
4608,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,Okay we can do that.,

4691,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,1,Oh my!  10K is way lower than I would think about.  This car is in great working order- it's been well taken care of.  I have to stick with my original offer,
4692,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,0,"I understand.  How about $11,000 cash -- out the door!!",

4696,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,0,"That's way more than I wanted to pay.  It's almost 10 years old. While it's a great car, I wouldn't pay more than $12,500.",
4697,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,1,"I can go down to $15000.  But, that is way lower than what I was willing to do originally.",
4698,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,0,"How about we settle at $14,000.  You'll have cash in hand and I'll have a new car.",
4699,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,1,$14500 and you have a deal.,
4700,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,0,OK.  I'm sure I'll be happy with it.  Deal.,
4755,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,What all does the phone already have on it?,
4756,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,The phone is completely erased with no leftover data from the previous user.,
4757,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I was hoping for music or something. Do you have the manual>,
4758,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,"There is a manual and there is iTunes leftover credit for $12, so you can buy some music with that.",
4759,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,Is the screen like new?,
4760,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,"Yes! No scratches. It currently has a screen protector on it, which you can chose to keep on or take off.",
4761,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I could offer $230.00,
4762,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,I would sell for $300.,
4763,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,$250?,

4765,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I could do $255 with the headphones.,
4766,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,1,I would do $265 without the headphones or $280 with headphones.,
4767,C_eb04b84ea3144c0984f0d8704c7386e7,0,I'll meet you half way at $260 with the headphones.,

4808,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,0,Hi!  I am interested in your bike.  How long have you had it?,
4809,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,1,I'm glad you're interested. We've only had it for about 6 months. It only has about 50 miles on it!,
4810,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,0,"That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try.",
4811,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,1,"Well my wife has definitely enjoyed it, so if yours is like mine I'm sure she will too! I've listed this at $1100 and I expect it to go quickly.",
4812,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,0,"I won't argue that it is a decent price.  Just wondering, is there anything wrong with it?  Seems like a lot to spend on a bike that only has 50 miles of usage...",
4813,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,1,I'm not aware of anything wrong with it - unless you count the fact that it's taking up space in my garage that I'd like to use for other things!,
4814,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,0,"Well, I would love to take it off of your hands at $800.  I'll throw in a birthday party invite. lol",
4815,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,1,"If you can make it $900 and pick it up today, I think we can make a deal",

4817,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,1,Fantastic!,
5217,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Hi, can you tell me more about the condition of the iPhones?",
5218,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"Both are like new.  My parents who are retired used them for about 6-7, with less than 10 hours of talk time.",
5219,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"What does it mean they used them ""for about 6-7""?",
5220,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"oops!  sorry, it's late and I'm trying hard to get these phones sold.  I meant to say they used them for about 6-7 months.",
5221,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Ok. Well, I think that those phones probably got a good amount of use in 6-7 months. So, would you be willing to accept a price of $75?",
5222,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,"No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone.",
5223,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",
5224,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,1,I think we can do that since you're local.  190 for both phones and I will deliver.  How's tomorrow afternoon?,
5225,C_50cb8b430e82467d98f4c06c8ce29f02,0,sounds good,

5339,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,0,That sounds good. How long have you had it?,
5340,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,1,I have had it just over seven months.,
5341,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,0,Okay. That's not too long. I'd like to buy it from you for $7 since it has been used.,
5342,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,1,that is less than half of asking...,
5343,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,0,"I realize that but I'm site unseen. For a used object, I think that is fair.",
5344,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,1,"Well I really do want to make a deal with you , but you need to come up a little in theprice, it is almost brand new.",
5345,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,0,The best I can do is $9 if you're willing to hold it for me for 2 days while I wait for my paycheck.,
5346,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,1,I suppose I could do that. 9 sounds fair enough,
5347,C_3523a52326894f5a98ccd44a145a5d2f,0,Awesome. Then $9 it is. It was great doing business with you.,
5348,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,0,hello,

5351,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,1,"Great, well, I think you'd enjoy this car, and it's a steal at $12000.",
5352,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,0,"yeah thats the problem, I ve been checking my cash and I don't have that much",
5353,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,1,"Well that's okay, I take credit too :)",
5354,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,0,"yeah I have a problem with that too, I already maxed out, so let's try and find a solution, how about 9 large",
5355,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,1,"Friend, check out the description of this fine automobile that I posted. It's got a new radiator, fresh tires, I mean, the list goes on!",
5356,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,0,"but friend it's 8 years old, so what about 9850, i think it's fair and I will take care of the delivery charges",
5357,C_c45de9ee2d1a410caff4d221284b9bf9,1,"Okay, I think that is a fair deal.",

6173,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,0,"Well the interior looks nice from the picture but what color is it? Also, did you smoke in it?",
6174,C_b6902ac6a2774b309995eb2a0f334737,1,It's a light silver color. Smoke has never entered this beauty.,

6201,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"It's true the handle is unattached, but as it also states the handle is with the dresser. There are a small number of beauty marks from regular use, but other the the handle, no noticeable damage.",

6203,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,1,"That is less than I paid for the night stand alone, that is unacceptable. If the handle is a concern, I can however lower the total price to 175.",
6204,C_f6800a01f96d42a7a1ec9ec6950dce87,0,"Well, I'd be willing to come pick it up, but I really couldn't go more than $110.",

6652,C_5f01b4a3fb3b40b9832799c1ae80a3e1,1,yes it is and can use most any network,

6667,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,1,"Hi, are you interested in the bike?",
6668,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,0,yes. but it's kinda pricey for a 27 yr old bike.,
6669,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,1,"I know, but this is a collector's bike.  So people generally fix them up and only ride the bike to show off.  It's actually worth quite a bit because it is so old, yet in decent condition.",
6670,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,0,needing a handbrake isn't in a decent condition. tell you what. i'll give you 100 for it.,
6671,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,1,How about if I throw in a hand brake and you can install it yourself for $150?,
6672,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,0,yeah that's not gonna work for me. 110 is the max i'd pay for a bike in this condition,
6673,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,1,Is there something else I can throw in to sweeten the deal?,
6674,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,0,"nah. 110, bike and the handbrake. if that's ok we got a deal",
6675,C_033934a5cb6b4bcb94a4202525cd3126,1,Okay deal.,
6676,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,0,Hello. I am interested in your Felt bike.,
6677,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,"HI, so you are interested in the bike, right?",
6678,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,0,Yes very much so. My son has been begging me for this bike,
6679,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,It's a great bike. Can I answer any questions for you? It's a great price considering all the extras it has,
6680,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,hello?,
6681,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,0,Sorry. My son knows alot about this bike. I was wondering if you are willing to lower the price any?,
6682,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,"I put a lot of extras into this bike and it is in great condition. I can go down a little bit, but not too much. I am asking 250, but I can probably do 225",
6683,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,0,That is exactly what i have saved up. My son is going to be so surprised on his birthday. Thank you.,
6684,C_1686a2b184ca4c51bb1155f1e4d07615,1,Sounds great. Can you pick up today?,

6812,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,0,Hello there. I was wondering if I would be able to stop by and check this house out to see the inside,
6813,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,1,"Sure, you can come by anytime after 1 pm tomorrow. How much are you hoping to spend on this?",
6814,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,0,"I am looking to pay around 1350, are you willing to lower the price you are asking?",
6815,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,1,"Yes, but 1350 seems a bit too much for me to lower it. Does 2300 work for you?",
6816,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,0,"Well it is fully furnished, right?",
6817,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,1,Yes it is. It also has Comcast cable with all channels and you get house cleaning twice per month.,
6818,C_74e6c71a6263457b9133b4eb99c45699,0,Okay that is a lot so I would be good with paying 2300,

6852,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,0,"Hi so I'm interested in buying the bedroom set, are there any scratches?",
6853,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,1,"No scratches, it's in very good condition",

6856,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,0,"Well a new bedroom set like this I could probably buy from the store for $500, so I'd have to say since it's used it needs to be in the 150 price range.",
6857,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,1,"Last time I was in the store, a whole bedroom set which included the bed, dresser and two night stands was on sale for $1500 brand new.  I can go as low as 275.00",
6858,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,0,"I still can't do that, look if you deliver it I can literally go down to $240 no lower.",
6859,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,1,I can do $240 as long as you're in a 15-mile radius.,
6860,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,0,I can be there in an hour.,
6861,C_c9fd7ac35eca4531b1a544710f1a8633,1,you need to accept the $240 offer,
6882,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,0,Does it offer bluetooth?,
6883,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,1,It doesn't i'm sorry,
6884,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,0,Well that will effect my final price...is it a 2-way speaker?,
6885,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,1,I'm not sure what you mean by 2-way,
6886,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,0,It just is something about the sound resonation I think I really do not know the specifics I just know you shpuld make sure any speakers you buy are two way.,
6887,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,1,Sine I don't know that I will be able to lower the price for you if that helps.,

6889,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,1,Again I'm not sure. This is my sons so I don't know much about it except that he asked if I could sell if for him.,
6890,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,0,Ok I am going to submit my offer for the speaker directly.,
6891,C_9f57157582ca450e9cf4bd02df4ee7aa,1,Okay that's good,

6998,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,OK Thats good to hear. I really like the bike but i think $250 would have been a fair price about 5 years ago :/,
6999,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"Lol  hey!  vintage is in!!  Ok, since you're being a good sport how does 200 sound?",
7000,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,"its a little bit out of my price range still, I really need the bike to get to my new job. I have $125 to spare but i can walk to pick it up from you if that helps?? We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up",
7001,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150",
7002,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,0,I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :),
7003,C_ec21cc8b09724b8fbd30a538fdbeb0f3,1,"You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!",

7093,C_c6feb4a5a7234051adcccf4d2741014b,1,sorry...that s/h been 565.  This is an excellent apartment complex.  Too many amenities to list but I will guarantee you would find everything you are looking for here.,
7094,C_c6feb4a5a7234051adcccf4d2741014b,0,The price is a little high for me?  Would you be willing to come down?,
7095,C_c6feb4a5a7234051adcccf4d2741014b,1,I understand.  I can come down a little but I will not be able to honor the $500 off move in.  What price range did you have in mind?,
7096,C_c6feb4a5a7234051adcccf4d2741014b,0,"$1500.  Of course, if utilities are covered and there is a gym and a pool, I could go a bit higher.",

7113,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,"That is too low for an unlocked phone in great condition.  I can lower the price to $300, but that is the best I can do.  I need the money from this phone to buy some other things.",
7114,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,I see it is has some condition issues  and it is used  not to mention on the smaller side as far as memory goes,
7115,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,The issue is cosmetic.  I can bring the price down to $275 if that bothers so.  I can also throw in a free headset.  Deal?,
7116,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,0,i can do 150 thats pretty much the best i can do  275 is still to much,
7117,C_1f2b890088534549a9d8e260f308b251,1,I cannot sell it that low.  Do you have anything else you can give me plus the money to see if we can make a deal?,

7259,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"It looks nice, but I really don't think it's worth what you're asking.",
7260,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"How come? It was very well maintained through our company, everything runs perfect on it. Just like new.",
7261,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,It's 6 years old and that mileage seems high. If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time,
7262,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever.",
7263,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000",
7264,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you.",
7265,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty",
7266,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back!",
7267,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer.",
7268,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount. I'll pend you an offer. Think about it. Thank you for your time either way!",

7303,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Vey well. How can i help you?,
7304,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,Do you have the title to the truck? Are there other rips on the seats? When was the last time it had a tune up?,
7305,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,Yes i have the title! Not only are there no rips on the seats they are heated as well. The entire interior is beautiful and it was barely driven it only has 68000 miles on it.,
7306,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,0,Super now is it at all possible to lower the price? It's something I'd like it's just out of my budget.,
7307,C_a03bad43ef554b5b858e4ddde3d4d459,1,I would be willing to go to 6000 but no lower. Are you willing to accept that?,

7888,C_eb0371b1374048169f3e27bb35c2d057,0,"No, not unless you offer some incentive. Can I have a 500 dollar rebate?",

7918,C_6aad17e62d66451eba55eafedccf232c,0,"Thats great, but I do not need any more. How about 500 for whats listed?",
7919,C_6aad17e62d66451eba55eafedccf232c,1,I think at this point if I would go any lower it would most likely be 800.00 which is a steal in all honesty.,

9890,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,0,Hello,
9891,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,1,hello. are you interested in this car? do you have the budget to be interested in this car? I have had a bunch of low ballers today,

9893,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,1,"it is in good conditions. no issues and only had 42,000 miles on it",

9896,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,0,Cool. Would you be willing to lower the price?,
9897,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,1,"I cant lower the price because it is leased through hayward toyota and this is the balance that needs to be paid off. The good news is that once it is transferred to you, you can just make payments every month and dont need to have all of the money at one time",
9898,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,0,That sounds alright to me. How about 20000 then?,
9899,C_fdebec1d17924b1bbf0748ab1e682fbd,1,"i can knock 900 off but, no more than that. 21,000 even okay?",

9936,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,0,Is there an application fee?,
9937,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,1,application fee is included in the price of 2471.00,
9938,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,0,How is the parking there? Does it come with a garage? Is there a pool at the location? Any utilities included?,
9939,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,1,there are many amenities the garage is extra.  There is a shared pool.,
9940,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,0,"Well, the price is pretty steep considering that a garage is not included and I am assuming there is no utilities included. The unit is quite small. I could do $1700",
9941,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,1,I can include utilities for 2000.00,
9942,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,0,That is still a little steep considering how small this unit is. I would really have to do some downsizing to be able to move it. I am very interested in it though. Can you do any better on the price?,
9943,C_4b2c9cb615c845e8a15b4036ade9add1,1,Well since it is a brand new property with secured entry and controlled access I can offer one month free on storage with no utilities paid for 1950.00,

9985,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,0,I need what you are selling. It is a service right and not a tangible object?,
9986,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,1,Right we can unlock or flash your phone so that you can use your phone on another network as most carriers lock their phones so you are stuck with them.,
9987,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,0,That sounds pretty good. Are you willing to negotiate on the price a bit?,

9991,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,0,"Okay, so how much do you want?",
9992,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,1,It would be $50 everything included that is normally a $80 package,
9993,C_5d54fd51a8bb43019a9644f2763143af,0,"Okay, that works for me.",

12905,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,I noticed the photos aren't of the actual unit. Is this a unit on the property or just a unit that is similar?,
12906,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,They are very similar pretty much look just alike.,
12907,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,Awesome. How much wiggle room do you have on that price. It's a big high for me.,

12938,C_ebb745b7c9a64df6bd3df5f71e42cd2a,1,Yes within reason of course. Salsa bikes are fully customizable and I know you didn't customize this one for yourself so I wouldn't expect you to spend the thousands that some people do on Salsa bikes,

12940,C_ebb745b7c9a64df6bd3df5f71e42cd2a,1,I didn't think I would go so low but I like you so I'll go to 600. I did just get new chains and everything redone on it and I can throw in the saddle and pedals if you would like,

It get's like 25 miles per gallon because I added this vortex thing to the engine that allows the air flow to be more efficient and bigger gas milieage - it's custom!",
12948,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,Nice. It is almost two decades old though which makes your price seem a bit steep. How far down are you willing to come?,

12960,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,I see it is listed for $140 is there anyway you can go lower.  Let's say $70?,

12962,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,What price point are you thinking?,
12963,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,1,It actually retails for 150 but I really need to get rid of it. I need the money. How about 115?,

12979,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,I think 2200 is a very fair price for this TV,
12980,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,I've heard that Samsungs have issues. I've heard the Toshiba's are the best TV's.,

17142,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,1,Wonderful! Do you have any questions about it?,
17143,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,0,How good of condition is it in?,
17144,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,1,It has the usual small chips in the paint and a tad bit of fade on the decals but no crash damage and the frame is straight as an arrow!,
17145,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,0,"That's no problem! I would like to come pick it up as soon as possible, if you'd be willing to accept $420.",
17146,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,1,"$500? It has carbon fork, carbon seatpost and compact cranks 50-34",
17147,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,0,"Well, that's still a little higher than anticipated but it is a great bike and I'd hate to lose it to someone else, so I can do $500.",
17148,C_7e62658d6fb34ed5b2f65174b9c10a56,1,awesome!!!,

17160,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,"Hi the mileage is at around 11000 but the tires are very, very good.",
17161,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,"wow, so I guess all in town travel then. What's that gas mileage like?",
17162,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,"Oh yes, only in town and very lightly used. It is in the best condition of any Dodges that you will probably ever see. It get's like 25 miles per gallon because I added this vortex thing to the engine that allows the air flow to be more efficient and bigger gas milieage - it's custom!",
17163,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,Nice. It is almost two decades old though which makes your price seem a bit steep. How far down are you willing to come?,
17164,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,"Yes I am willing to come down to say about 3100, I really don't wanna go below 3000 because I've spent alot on the engine air intake modifier which no other vehicle is likely to have until say about 2025. How does this sound/",
17165,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,I do a lot of work on cars myself and I'm not sure that's what I'm looking for.,
17166,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,"I see, how much are you willing to pay?",
17167,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,maybe 2000,
17168,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,"I don't know if that will work, can you offer anything else in to trade?",
17169,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,I have four brand new 15 inch rims that I was going to put on my chevy before someone totaled it,
17170,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,1,Oh wanna throw those in and we can call it 2000?,
17171,C_69c85ca8400242f29fbb7ae7a36872ba,0,"that will work, I sure don't need them anymore",

17173,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,"Hi, I am interested in the Sony Bluetooth Speaker. Is this item new or used?",
17174,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,1,It's new. I've had it for 3 weeks,
17175,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,I see it is listed for $140 is there anyway you can go lower. Let's say $70?,
17176,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,1,70 is much too low but I'm still willing to come down a little bit,
17177,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,What price point are you thinking?,
17178,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,1,It actually retails for 150 but I really need to get rid of it. I need the money. How about 115?,
17179,C_d0078b2b6a6f40d1b9ceb4204e0b432a,0,I can do $115 and I can come pick it up tomorrow if that's okay with you.,

17194,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,I think 2200 is a very fair price for this TV,
17195,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,I've heard that Samsungs have issues. I've heard the Toshiba's are the best TV's.,
17196,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,I would have to disagree as I have not heard the same thing,
17197,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,"I really need a new TV and your's is the only one even close to what I Want. I will not pay $2,200 though. I think $1,200 is fair.",
17198,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,This TV is brand new and super nice quality. I would be willing to sell it for $2000,
17199,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,"The ad says it's a 2016. That means it is a year old. So it is NOT brand new. $1,500",
17200,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,"true not BRAND new, but it has not been used and is in perfect condition. I would be willing to sell it for 1800. That is a good deal because it comes with several accessories and a warranty",
17201,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,How long is the warranty for?,
17202,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,1,until January 2018,
17203,C_7d90f748d3524a8eb49a87bbadd4e5c9,0,Will you deliver?,

17208,C_51b97600116342b8a1535d82b80a40d0,1,Yes it is. It is in good condition and a very nice vintage bike.,
17209,C_51b97600116342b8a1535d82b80a40d0,0,how are the tires and chain on it? and are you willing to negotiate on that price?,
17210,C_51b97600116342b8a1535d82b80a40d0,1,The tires and chains are in good condition. I am willing to negotiate the price. What price point are you thinking?,
17211,C_51b97600116342b8a1535d82b80a40d0,0,"I'm not actually a collector I just like vintage things, so it may be worth 150 to a collector but 125 fits more into my budget",
17212,C_51b97600116342b8a1535d82b80a40d0,1,I understand. I can do $125 if you can come pick it up by tomorrow?,

17358,C_5507486231744100ad93e625f49c7566,0,Does the HOA charge any fees? Any fees for pool access? How old is the house?,
17359,C_5507486231744100ad93e625f49c7566,1,The house was built in 2006 and the HOA fees are included in the rent,

17363,C_5507486231744100ad93e625f49c7566,1,Considering that you will be paying utilities and landscaping I'm willing to drop the price to 1900,

17372,C_b351d35d35ba45539196bf3b903c7cbb,1,That's a little low. These cars go forever. Lot's of mileage still left on the vehicle.,
