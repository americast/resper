1701,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,0,hi there! Looking to get that apartment,
1702,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,1,"Sure, any questions?",
1703,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,0,Yea i noticed local apartments have a ton of TV channels. is this apartment similar?,
1704,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,1,"It comes with basic cable free, you have to pay for additional channels",
1705,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,0,What about internet?,
1706,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,1,You have to pay for internet service,
1707,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,0,Well i have to be honest. That list price is a bit high for having to also pay for TV and internet service. I love the apartment but the most I could go for is $1800,
1708,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,1,"Sorry I can't. All the apartments in this town require you pay for internet. I don't know of any free internet, and you always have to pay for premium channels.",
1709,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,0,how about $1900 in cash?,
1710,C_b65a20dd7e714ba98c2b50de030aa4c2,1,I can do $2300,

1712,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,Hello. I am interested in buying the sofa and the chair,
1713,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,1,$100 and it's yours.  it's a great deal to receive both items for that price.,
1714,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,"That's too much and I can't afford that, but before we get down to the price as mentioned in the listing the sofa was from Costco. Would you happen to have any warranty with it?",
1715,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,1,"no, there's no warranty",
1716,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,"Okay good to know that, and is the sofa black or brown?",
1717,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,1,it's dark brown.  $100 and you can have it,
1718,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,That's too much. I can give $76 for both since it has no warranty as well and its not new.,
1719,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,1,no one needs a warranty for a sofa.  it works just great.  it's very comfortable.  $100 is a great price.  you get the chair too.,
1720,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,Warranty is important for any wearing or tearing down. I can't do 100 its too much. You need to go lower a bit,
1721,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,1,$95.00,
1722,C_b3debfd6fb904d77bf3b6e3c08584eaf,0,Okay as far as you deliver it to me as I live very far from where you are please,

1883,C_22fad2cec6b64f04ac28e4d3f10c0d5d,1,"It is about 6 months old, I just wanted to upgrade",
1884,C_22fad2cec6b64f04ac28e4d3f10c0d5d,0,"Is it red, I don't like red, would it be possible for me to paint this blue to match my Subaru WRX ?",
1885,C_22fad2cec6b64f04ac28e4d3f10c0d5d,1,I can't see why not,
1886,C_22fad2cec6b64f04ac28e4d3f10c0d5d,0,"Alright sounds good, I can offer about 375 for this.",
1887,C_22fad2cec6b64f04ac28e4d3f10c0d5d,1,sounds like a deal,

2328,C_d3cbfc4bbdfe4c738d60ae83a09abb65,0,"And a fine tuning dial!! Who ever heard of such a thing??? In my day, dials didn't tune so fine. But don't get me started. How do you feel about $5?",
2329,C_d3cbfc4bbdfe4c738d60ae83a09abb65,1,In my day we had tin foil and spit... this is quite the leap in technology... I don't feel great about $5...I don't feel great. But... I feel pretty good about $10...,
2330,C_d3cbfc4bbdfe4c738d60ae83a09abb65,0,Hmmmm. We got ourselves a couple a shrewd operators here. It DOES provide precise control. Those darn buttons only have two positions. Pushed/Not Pushed. Where's the control there??? How about $8? Does that put more tin foil on your bunny ears?,
2331,C_d3cbfc4bbdfe4c738d60ae83a09abb65,1,Nah my bunny ears are still pretty fuzzy... 10 seems like a nice round even number I can really get on board with... Yep... I'm really digging that number 10...,
2332,C_d3cbfc4bbdfe4c738d60ae83a09abb65,0,"You drive a hard bargain, bunny ears. But I respect a person who carries quality antennae. Hard to find anymore. Throw in a wire hanger to adjust it with from my lay z boy and you got a deal.",

2783,C_ada9bff82aea4554bf98e40427d6a709,0,what can you offer me with that price,
2784,C_ada9bff82aea4554bf98e40427d6a709,1,It would be the same apartment just on a month to month lease.,

2854,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"Well, that's a lot closer, but I guess my problem is the area sounds really crowded. For example, right now I live in a very rural area, in fact if I see another person on an average day that's way too many people. I'm not even sure why I'm moving to California, since when the weather gets over 80 I get migraines :(",

2919,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"Yes, Its completely brand new. Never used.",
2920,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,Will it work with Boost Mobile?,
2921,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,It's unlocked and will work with every service provider.,
2922,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Excellent, I think my only concern is the lack of a warranty.  Do you provide any protection?  What if it breaks within the first week or month of using it?",
2923,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"Good question. It does not have a warranty, but I believe that apple-care is around $99. I could knock off a bit of the selling price so that you could purchase the apple-care. I'm looking to get this off my hands ASAP.",
2924,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Okay, I'm comparing it to several other offers I've seen on ebay.  What about if we do $550 so that I can get that applecare warranty and I'll bring you cash today?",
2925,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,"That's a bit low for me. This model sells for around $1,000 if you were to purchase a new one today and the condition of this phone is completely new and untouched. What if I offered $620?",
2926,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"I'm still a little nervous that it won't work with my network, if it doesn't work with Boost will you take it back within 24 hours?",
2927,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,I understand. I would definitely take it back as long as it's within a 24 hour period. You could check with your provider and get back to me. You could also do that while we're together before you even hand me the money.,
2928,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,0,"Okay good idea, then let's meet and I'll bring the $620 and call Boost while we're together, sound good?",
2929,C_b7e5ca05052441f28fcdabe1d724dc22,1,You have a deal.,
2964,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,0,Hello,

2968,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,0,Nice. I'm looking to pick one up and I'm willing to pay $197 for it.,
2969,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,1,"It is in mint condition, and still has all the original plastic add-on parts. You are welcome to try it out before purchasing it. I can't however go as low as $197.",
2970,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,0,I'd be willing to pay $225 if you can ship it out to me.,
2971,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,1,I would be willing to ship it for $230,
2972,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,0,Does that include the serrato software?,
2973,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,1,"I don't believe so, but information about the mixer can be found at https://serato.com/hardware/vestax-vci-300. maybe you can find some software there",
2974,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,0,"Hmm, ok. I'll take it for $230 and shipping provided by you.",
2975,C_ae674968cedc4c0294beafce439eaa8d,1,sounds good!,
3006,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,Hello,
3007,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,"Hi, I'm interested in your bike",
3008,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,I'm glad to hear that. It's a vintage 1960 Japanese made touring bike. This is a collector's type of bike but still in good shape if one were to be interested in riding it.,
3009,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,"It's just what I've been looking for.  I see it has a little surface rust, but other than that everything works ok?",
3010,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,"Yep, it's actually in good shape for how old it is. I'm asking for a price of $180",
3011,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,"Since I'd like to repair the surface rust, would you be willing to come down to say $136?",
3012,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,"Hmm, that's a lot lower than what I was looking to get. I'll throw in a bike pump and a helmet for $180!",
3013,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,That's just a little too high for me. I already have a helmet.  Could you do $145 and I'll pick it up myself today..,
3014,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,$155 and you got yourself a deal.,
3015,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,Can we split the difference and meet at $150. I'll even come before lunch.,
3016,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,Cash?,
3017,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,Yes,
3018,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,1,Deal!,
3019,C_4642e3e1d76443f181f4bf795aea0dd8,0,"Awesome, Thanks!",
3161,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,"Hi, I'm interested in your tandem bike.",
3162,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,"Hello, the price is $3000. It iis in good condition and trunks to hold items while you are riding.",
3163,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,A trunk would be nice. Is it in good condition? Any rust?,
3164,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,Yes in good condition and no there is no rust.,
3165,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,"Cool, is your price fixed or can you come down some?  It's a little out of my price range/",
3166,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,"You can make me an offer if you'd like.  I am pretty firm on the 3000 range, I could come down a tad bit.",
3167,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,"I have $2280 cash, I could come get it today.",
3168,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,$2280 is too low.  Could you do more like 2750?,
3169,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,That's just too high for my budget.  Can you come down any lower?,
3170,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,$2700 is my absolute lowest.,
3171,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,Can you deliver it for that price?,
3172,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,1,Yes,
3173,C_76f5abc99eb24eb4aefbb7309ba07ae4,0,"Ok, deal",
3198,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Hi, I'm interested in the bike you are selling",
3199,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Hello thank you for takning an interest this is a very reliable bike that would make a great addition to any bike ride.,
3200,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,How old is the bike? Does it need anything?,
3201,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,The bike is about 1 year old  as it is a 2016 model. Unfortunately it does lack pedals.,
3202,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,Well I don't mind getting pedals for it.  Could you come down on the price then since I would have to buy them?,
3203,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Sure I wouldnt mind doing so. You could purchase a great pair of pedals for around $60 so ill take $60 off.,
3204,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Oh, that would still be out of my price range quite a bit. I have $1520 in cash and I could pick it up today if you'd accept?",
3205,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,Could you possibly go maybe $200 higher? As I said before this is only a 1 year old bike and it does come with various capabilities making it ideal for various terrain.,
3206,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"How about 1680, and I will pick it up within the next hour?",
3207,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,$ 1698 and You got a deal Ill also throw in a full can of rust protectant spray for the chain and any other exposed metal parts.,
3208,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Ok, can you deliver it for that price?",
3209,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,1,That would depend on distance but yes I certainly could.,
3210,C_b37b106e158f404aad42f3ff9e5a3e32,0,"Ok, I'll take it.",
3221,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Hi! Can you tell me more about this bike? How old is it?,
3222,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,This bike is only two years old. A very sturdy bike constructed from steel. Also it is only slightly used as my child who I orignally bought it for hit a growth spurt shortly after.,
3223,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,"Does it have any issues? Flat tires, faulty brakes etc?",
3224,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,No there are no such issues I had sprayed the exposed metal parts with anti rust. Therefore the brakes still function smoothly. As for tires I had recently ensured to inflate back to the appropriate tire pressure.,
3225,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Would you take $70,
3226,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,That would be a little too low for me. Ihad previoulsy paid around 200 for it brand new so 70 would put me at quite a loss. I could throw in a bicyle bell if that would intrest you.,
3227,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,What about $80 and I'll pick it up?,
3228,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,Would you still want the bell in this case?,
3229,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,No.,
3230,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,1,Then that would be fine I could also meet you half way if necessary.,
3231,C_dd510b7b54b749628a7ec6f87eca3452,0,Perfect,

4605,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,I feel that is too much since it is damaged already and have to try to repaint and repair it.,
4606,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,1,The paint is very fresh and does not need a new coat. The price I paid last year was $300 so you are getting it for less than 1/3,
4607,C_aa7ae43a87a744d793f37aa2b55bc236,0,"I need to paint it if there is a chip, either I can do 60 cash and come get it, or I will have to pass.",

4737,C_12e9db14b98f4dd3ada65173f70c148a,1,"Well, the mileage is high because I have to travel a lot for business, and this was the car I drove all around the southwest. I'd be willing to let it go for $6000.",

5099,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,"I think fixing it would cost $50, so I could subtract that from the asking price, if you'd like.",
5100,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Whats your bottom dollar on it?,
5101,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,"I'd like to sell it for $225. Or, I could do I could do it for $250 and deliver it to you tomorrow.",
5102,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Well I can come get it and getting it fixed should knock down the price too.How about 200?,
5103,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,You want 200 and I want 225. Let's meet in the middle at 212.50. We can say 212. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?,
5104,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,You couldn't let it go for 210?,

5196,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Sounds like a plan! Do you have any questions about the table?,

5199,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,Yes. It's used. But in a very nice condition still. sturdy and structurally sound. I say 100 is a good price,
5200,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,I would never pay the list price for a used table. How about $50?,
5201,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,it's an oak table. oak is an expensive wood because it's so dense and heavy. makes for great furniture wood. I'll go as low as 80 but that's about it.,
5202,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,"I will pay $70, under the condition that I will come and pick up the table! Is that ok with you? You wont have to pay for shipping or the cost of gas.",

5205,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,"no, I won't polish it. it's sold as is",
5206,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Ok perfect! You are a great salesman. Thank you,
5241,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,"Hi there,interested in your lamp.",
5242,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,great! its still avaliable and can be picked up whenever. I'm asking $80 for it.,
5243,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,do you smoke?,
5244,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,"nope, lamp is from a smoke and pet free home",
5245,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,"well that is important, can you tell me what type of silk the shade has on it?",
5246,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,teal silk from Italy. I had the lampshade made out of a scarf I bought on a cruise. The lamp itself is less than 3 months old.,
5247,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,that sounds lovely but I am on a budget. I was hoping we could negotiate the price down.,
5248,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,"I'd be willing to take $60 but I'd have to take the lightbulbs out and replace them with basic bulbs,",
5249,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,0,Could we do 55?,
5250,C_e918b7a5c6324e7b9318dcb036feebbc,1,sure,
5263,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"Hi, any questions about the listing?",
5264,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,"Yes, how old is the lamp?",
5265,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"I received it as a gift recently. It's practically new, as stated in the advert.",
5266,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,What is your asking price?,
5267,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal",
5268,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,
5269,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no.",
5270,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,
5271,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,Exactly. Is $75 good?,
5272,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,"Hm, well I was going to use that extra 2 dollars to buy my wife a very well deserved 10 year anniversary gift. However I think this lamp will make us both happier. I can't let it go. You have a deal!",

5558,C_06250c20debf404a95221088dbe85c73,1,That should be fine,

5702,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,Can you tell me anything about it,
5703,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"I am the original owner, bought it new in 2006.  Great vehicle - has never left me stranded.  The interior is nearly pristine and the exterior looks very good (some dings like you would expect from an 11 year old vehicle).  Still drives great.  Only 85,000 miles.",
5704,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,"Ok, how much are you asking?",
5705,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,I'm asking $7800.  I bought a new Escalade and no longer need this one.,
5706,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,"Ok, I will offer you 4600 for it.",
5707,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"Uh, no.  Book on it is $8300.  I'm already below that.  I'd be willing to consider an offer that is more reasonable, but $4600 is over three-thousand below my asking price.",
5708,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,Well to be honest I found the same care with less miles for cheaper.  If oyu are willing to throw in a warranty and deliver it for me I will offer more.,
5709,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"OK, I can offer a 1 year warranty and will bring it to you, but I need you to make an offer.",

5711,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,Make it an even $7000 and you have a deal.,
5723,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Hey I really want that bike but it seems a bit to pricy mind if we talk about it?,
5724,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,"Sure, I will answer any questions you have.",
5725,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Well I get you upgraded it and its a 2017 model but how used is it?,
5726,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,I only used it a few times. I really do not have time to ride it due to my job.,
5727,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,ok that's fine and how are the tires and current chain,
5728,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,Both are in excellent condition. Not a scratch on the bike.,
5729,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Ok well im working with a budget of 684. Now i should remind you this is still a used bike and even with your upgrades it wouldn't push it too 900 I could get a completely stock bike for 779,
5730,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,"I am actually taking a loss asking the $900. I am willing to negotiate on the price, however, I cannot go that low.",
5731,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,Well yes selling this.  Bike without much use.  Is certainly a loss for you but i did my reasearch and your exact model and your upgrades have gone down in price when bought brand new now a brand new bike with those up grades would run me about 820 so that would certainly mean your bike value has significantly reduced. If 684 is too low I can do 699 and i will pick it up,
5732,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,This bike was only used three times and it has been parked in a garage. It is very clean with many upgraded parts. I could do $790 and I will deliver it to you.,
5733,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,How about 740 with meet me halfway delivery,
5734,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,I can do $750 with meeting halfway for delivery.,
5735,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,0,745. Sound good that's really the best I can do,
5736,C_3209a468e7d845ada4127e3e4f576703,1,"Okay, you got yourself a deal.",
5737,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,What is the lowest price you are willing to accept?,
5738,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,How old is this sofa,
5739,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,"I don't remember exactly, but I think I bought it about 5 years ago.",
5740,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,What is the color?,
5741,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,It's light grey... In a dark room it looks as if it's almost white.,
5742,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,Okay. In your ad you stated you had it only for a year but now you say you think you bought it about 5 years ago. Which is correct?,
5743,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,"Originally I had bought it for my son for his apartment. However, he's got married and I needed a new sofa for my man cave. So he gave it to me. My wife wants to turn my man cave into a sewing room so I have to sell it.",
5744,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,"Okay so it has been used by two different people then? I am interested in the sofa, however, the price you are asking is a bit steep for a sofa that is 5 years old and used by two different people. Are you willing to negotiate on the price?",
5745,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,Understood... How about if I lower it to $300 and I'll even deliver it to you myself.,
5746,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,"If you could go to $200, I would come and get it today with cash in hand.",
5747,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,That's a little lower than I wanted to get for it. How about $260 and I'll deliver it.,
5748,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,0,Can you do $220 with me picking it up? It is 5 years old.,
5749,C_701c748c1a974eb29f8c6ba75446cb6a,1,Deal.,
5750,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"Hey, you're interested in the sofa set?",
5751,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,"Yes, I am.  Can you tell me a bit more about it?",
5752,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"Yeah, we've used the couch for only a few years, my wife wants to upgrade as we move out of town, it's pretty peerless, not many stains.",
5753,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,"Is it pretty well-built, substantial?",
5754,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"Definitely, the cushions haven't really changed since we bought it, which is nice. It's like beige.",
5755,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,I'm a little bothered by the light color. What kind of fabric is it?,
5756,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"It might be corduroy or upholstered fabric, I can't remember that well. Well if you don't like the fabric that much, I could throw in the pillows too, if you want.",
5757,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,I'd like that - I like to be comfortable when I watch TV and this looks like a good set for it.  So what would you take for it?,
5758,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"525 for the set with the pillows, I'll bring it down a little, as you seem genuinely interested despite any setbacks.",
5759,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,Hmmm...how about delivery?  I can see that price if you can bring it to me - I'm just across town but don't have a truck and would have to borrow one.,
5760,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,"Oh yeah we have a truck, I'll handle that for you. How does later in the week sound?",
5761,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,Friday after work?,
5762,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,1,I can do that.,
5763,C_74eee51aaf34496c89704fd4a319f14f,0,"Done, then.  $525 with the pillows and delivery.",
5885,C_da24156b70a24c739517e4639aee752e,1,"Hey, you're interested n the bike?",
5886,C_da24156b70a24c739517e4639aee752e,0,Is it clean?,
5887,C_da24156b70a24c739517e4639aee752e,1,"Yeah, I serviced it and cleaned it to be ready for you to use it",
5888,C_da24156b70a24c739517e4639aee752e,0,Would it fit in my Toyata Corolla or should I bring my Suv to pick it up?,
5889,C_da24156b70a24c739517e4639aee752e,1,"oh, yeah it's 29 inches, I'll drop it off at your house with my truck. Definitely would not fit inside Corolla sorry",

5974,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,Hello,
5975,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Hello!,
5976,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,You looking to but,
5977,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,The bike looks great. Do you know how new the tires are?,
5978,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,I replaced them about a year ago.,
5979,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Do you know how many miles are on them?,
5980,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,They just sat there. I'd guess 10-20 at the most.,
5981,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Hmmm...Just sitting there isn't good for a bike. That makese me a bit nervous. I'm happy to offer $150 for this without any new tires on them.,
5982,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,"That's too low for me, how about $180?",
5983,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,$180 is a bit high for me but I could settle at $175 in as-is condition,
5984,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,"That'd work, better than having it just sit and riot.",
6006,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,hello,
6007,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,Hi!,
6008,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,How large is the mirror?,
6009,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,"It is 63 inches high or 5 feet 3 inches, and 27 1/2 inches wide.",
6010,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,I don't know if that will fit in my car.  Can you deliver it?,
6011,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,I could do that as I have a van that it will fit in.,
6012,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,Awesome,
6013,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,Different fasteners are included so you can put it on any wall in your home.,
6014,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,That sounds perfect.  How does ten dollars sound?,
6015,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,"Well, since you want me to deliver it, how about $18?",
6016,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,That's a little high,
6017,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,It's an Ikea mirror. We didn't use it because we found out we have to move right after we bought it.,
6018,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,0,I could do 13.  But if I'm going to spend almost twenty dollars on a mirror I would rather buy it new.,
6019,C_a966addb42644ea2884997c84dafbee4,1,It is still in the box. I guess I could do $15.,
6064,C_1d3ca6c8af82413c94319c4148d12477,0,hello how are you,

6071,C_1d3ca6c8af82413c94319c4148d12477,1,"It has laundry on site, its close to schools and shopping, its near the transit center and easy freeway access. Oh, did I tell you that I pay for the water and garbage? Thats included in the price",
6072,C_1d3ca6c8af82413c94319c4148d12477,0,well how about this offer,
6073,C_1d3ca6c8af82413c94319c4148d12477,1,Will you put up a deposit fee? Thats kinda low I'm afraid,

6075,C_1d3ca6c8af82413c94319c4148d12477,1,"Great! We can deal! I have to add, no pets or smoking okay?",
6138,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,Hi! I hear you're interested in the Santa Clara apartment,
6139,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,Yes it looks beautiful. Is there a backyard?,
6140,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,There's no individual backyard but there's a communal outdoors area that you won't be responsible for maintaining!,
6141,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,That's great. The wife and kids will love that. Does it come fully furnished?,
6142,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"No, you'll be responsible for furnishing it yourself.",
6143,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,"Hmm that may be a problem with all of those steps we need to climb. The bed, the grand piano, the grandfather clock...",
6144,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,No worries! It's a first-floor apartment,
6145,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,Why was the unit extensively remodeled after only 2 years? Was there some sort of damage?,
6146,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"Not particularly. We like to replace all carpets after tenants who have pets -- even if there is not extensive damage, we find new tenants enjoy the brand-new features. If you think you might be interested in a tour, we can set something up?",
6147,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,0,We can but the price seems a bit steep for only 2 bedrooms. I know the asking price is $2595 but would $2000 be doable?,
6148,C_c580f823020a4ddb8e09bab9083af0e1,1,"Sorry, no. That's much too low for the area. I'm confident we'll have interest in the apartment at $2595. I can drop it as low as $2495.",
6219,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,0,It is nice.,
6220,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,1,"Hey there, you're interested in the table and chairs?",
6221,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,0,Looks a little dated.,
6222,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,1,"Sure, but the table would run you 80-100 without the chairs. I'm having a going away party. What's your budget.",
6223,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,0,I am very interested.,
6224,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,1,"Alright, 100 dollars then? Also, can you pick it up, or should I find a way to try to drop it off?",
6225,C_cf6ec66f986f4b4fbd0ec05e0ff4e803,0,$100 is too much. It does look a little dated and cheap...but reasonable. There are also scratches. I need a deal.,

6370,C_ba9417b39e314b7ab0f313fe53b589ea,0,I'm interested in this but is there anything wrong with it?,

6375,C_ba9417b39e314b7ab0f313fe53b589ea,1,That's not what they are going for. They are going for 850 and I'm selling them for 780 to sell them faster.,
6376,C_ba9417b39e314b7ab0f313fe53b589ea,0,"I cannot pay that much. I have seen most closer to 600, which is more in my price range.",
6377,C_ba9417b39e314b7ab0f313fe53b589ea,1,"Check again, most of them are selling for 850, this is the 128 GB version not the lower ones. I can go down to 750 but that's it.",

6392,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,"Yes, but there are some important details  you did not mention.  How many parking spaces do we get? And do you allow pets?",
6393,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,1,"Yup, pets are allowed upon approval, but I'm sure as long as you pick up after them and take care of them we'll be fine in that regard. And then, at the moment, there's plenty of ample parking because we have unsold units. We anticipate there will always be at least two parking spots for you, even during busy season.",
6394,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,"Well, it's good to hear that you would accept our cat.  And while there is plenty of parking now, we will need at least a spot for each of us.  But how about distance to BART, the transit station? Are you right off Highway 4 or over Willow Pass Road?",

6397,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,1,"We have XFINITY, which is Comcast, and its included in the rent.  Also included in the rent are the appliances such as laundry, washer, dryer, gas stove and range, as well as a fitness center. Seems like a good deal, no?",
6398,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?,
6399,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,1,"Well no, I don't believe any place includes the water and electricity at this price. We'll take care of the garbage and take it out for you, and no, the fee is included for the swimming pool because we have staff that maintain it.",
6400,C_915c44b93948435993443c12814bc649,0,"Well, that doesn't sound like a bad deal.  I think we will submit an offer for it.",

6781,C_2a95ee320167433dad8f576e0d4683ce,1,If you pay in cash today I am willing to go lower.,

6908,C_faaf0241b12640cea077ecfabb92cc13,0,"I'm interested, but $650 is what AT&T charges for the phone new from the store. For that price I get a warranty and know for sure that it's never been dropped, used, stolen, etc. Would you consider selling it for $400? I checked online and that seems to be the going rate.",
6909,C_faaf0241b12640cea077ecfabb92cc13,1,That might be a bit too low. Would you be willing to pay 500 dollars for it?,

6913,C_faaf0241b12640cea077ecfabb92cc13,1,"Yes, and I will throw that in for free as well. So, do we have a deal? 500 dollars.",
6914,C_faaf0241b12640cea077ecfabb92cc13,0,If you throw in a case and SD card I'll do $450.,
6915,C_faaf0241b12640cea077ecfabb92cc13,1,Even better. I will do that. 450. Is it a deal?,

7081,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,0,Does the batter still hold a good charge?,
7082,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,1,The battery has only been used a handful of times and still holds a good charge.,
7083,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,0,fantastic. WOuld you accept 650 for it?,
7084,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,1,That's a little too steep of a discount. It's almost brand new.,
7085,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,0,"OK, how about 675?",
7086,C_63e7cf9bd66d4153a74c0cef81130df5,1,How about 725 and I can spend a couple of hours teaching you how to fly it?,

7236,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,Good and you?,
7237,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,Very well thanks! Are you interested in my offer? Any questions?,
7238,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,"I am! It sounds good but people don't sell vehicles unless something is wrong with them soooo.... what is it's dings, bumps, bruises, quirks?",
7239,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,Nope absolutely nothing wrong with it I am simply upgrading! You are welcome to schedule an appointment to get it checked or take it for a test drive.,
7240,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,That would be perfect! Would you take $2500 for it?,
7241,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,No nothing near that low for a car this nice it only has 60000 miles on it and is in beautiful condition.,
7242,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,It is almost 8 years old and only has 60000 miles??? Did you ever drive it? How about $3000,
7243,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,My commute is only 5 miles and no that is less tham half my offer.,
7244,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,Alright then half of your offer $3500,
7245,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,1,No i;m afraid you will have to look elsewhere the lowest I'll go is 6000.,
7246,C_8ece56cf11d5472f8dd176e7496b07b5,0,At 8 years old the depreciation is 80% from it's original price as well as parts normally wear out between 8 to 10 years so although you may have a beautiful car it will begin to fall apart soon. $6000 is too much for an 8 year old car. I can go $3750,
7247,C_3b27c7241883469fac726cbe398b02a1,0,"Hello, I'm am interested in your apartment.",

7255,C_3b27c7241883469fac726cbe398b02a1,0,"Oh great, does $1800.00 work for you?",

7273,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,"Nice, the only reason I ask is because i'm looking at the photo and the leather looks like it's sagging a bit. I mean it shouldn't be a huge deal but it'll cost me out of pocket to get it refitted. could you possibly accept $200 for the sofa and loveseat?",
7274,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,"They are genuine leather, and they truly are in very good condition. $200 is a bit too low. The lowest I want to go is $280.",
7275,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,What if we meet halfway on this at $240. Also would you be able to drop this off for me? I'm local but I don't have access to a pickup truck.,

7277,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,What about $230 and I'll go rent a Uhaul myself? Those things are like $19 + mileage and gas.,
7278,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,I can do $245 with delivery,
7279,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,Okay that works for me,

7333,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"Indeed. I am. Just installed a new lamp and going for the low, low price of only $275!",
7334,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,What kind of condition is the TV in? Any problems with it?,
7335,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"Works like brand new, and like I said, basically just had it refurbished with the new lamp.",
7336,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,So it says on the listing that it's 10 years old? That price is a little high for such an old TV don't you think?,
7337,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"It was close to $6000 brand new, remember the thing is a 70 incher.",
7338,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,"You can get much newer 70 inch TVs for that price, could you come down a little on it?",
7339,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,"For a new TY, at that price you'd be lucky to get a 40 inch Chinese knock off brand at Walmar for that price. But tell you what, I'll toss in free delivery on the JVC.",
7340,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,"I think you are a little off on the pricing still, we're talking about 10 years here not 2 or 3. Would you take 200?",
7341,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,1,$220 and you do your own pick up.,
7342,C_0c98b926adf6466fb4a93978de0a30a4,0,Okay you have a deal.,

7486,C_a8fab516501e499db61378d2a6827415,1,Not a problem.  So the price is 4300 with a security deposit that is dependent on your credit.  When would you like to come take a look?,
7487,C_a8fab516501e499db61378d2a6827415,0,"Anytime is fine, but $4300 is way out of my budget, can we go down to 2100?",
7488,C_a8fab516501e499db61378d2a6827415,1,"There is no way that I can go that low.  Keep in mind that this price does include all utilities at an amazing property.  It really is a resort style property with an amazing pool as well as a bbq area that is just amazing.  This condo was just completely remodeled, we are actually putting the finishing touches on it right now.  The lowest that I would even be willing to consider would be 4100 a month.",

7600,C_2e3c34c5562b4d10870fac88f93b126c,0,Okay well considering it does have cosmetic damage can you bring the price down?,

7634,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,0,Can you do it for $600,
7635,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,1,600 would be way too low for me. I suppose I could knock the price down just a hair if you can get here quick. How does $1100 sound?,
7636,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,0,800 and it would be going to a good home and I would really appreciate it.,

7849,C_4ac1759bbec84952b1016e8a0b4ffe77,1,"Well I did just give it a tune up and oil change. Also, I recently changed the head gasket and erg valve.",
7850,C_4ac1759bbec84952b1016e8a0b4ffe77,0,"That all helps a lot! I will go up to 3,400.",

7934,C_c6a0a57e1ef542fa80c34bfc11fcb907,0,that seems a bit high. I know it's nice but The Upper Dimond district isnt the best. Can you do $1500?,
7935,C_c6a0a57e1ef542fa80c34bfc11fcb907,1,"That is really way too low.  This house is beautifully maintained, has hardwood floors, upgraded bathroom, and kitchen.",

7957,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,0,Hello! I am very interested in your ford ranger,
7958,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,1,perfect! Im asking 8700 for it.,
7959,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,0,I see that. I can't really afford that much at this time. I just bought a house and I am a little tight on funding. I was hoping I could see if maybe you could go a little lower than 8700. I mean the car is a little older. And I really need this truck!,
7960,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,1,"It is a little older, but everything works.  it has less than 42000 miles on it, it's practically unused. I can go to $8000 if it makes it easier for you?",
7961,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,0,I do see that. Can you provide a fax report as well? I was kind of hoping you would maybe accept an offer of 7500,
7962,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,1,I can do 7700 and bring it to you?,

7965,C_4f9c3212898f4c6bbd24c78734ae67bd,0,Yes please!,
8262,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"Hi, I am interested in this house. Can you tell what you think it is worth per month?",
8263,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,5 grand,
8264,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,That is ridiculous. I was thinking more around 1700 a month.,
8265,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Well that's what its worth you can ask city hall if you want they will say 5 grand,
8266,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"That is funny, because the original list price is only 2480.",
8267,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,"Yeah that's for rent to own, but you have to rent it to own it",
8268,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"I understand that. So if I wanted to do rent to own and I could set up a direct deposit, how about 1800 a month?",
8269,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,That's already low can you afford 2 grand,
8270,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,I'll split it at 1900. Is that enough?,
8271,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Makes me think you won't be able to pay rent u low ballin,
8272,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"That will not be a issue. I said we could set it up as a direct deposit, so obviously I am not worried about having the money. 1950 is my final offer.",
8273,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Okay I can agree on 1950 if you can find me a way besides Direct deposit that you can prove to me you'll be able to make rent every month,
8274,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,I'll get you a copy of my pay stubs. You will see how much I make.,
8275,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,How much u make a month? How long you been working and how much are your expenses every month?,

8277,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Okay we meet,
8434,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,Hello,
8435,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,Hi! I am interested in your truck. How is the paint?,
8436,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"Paint is great, not a single scratch or ding.",
8437,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Great! I would be willing to do 600, on account of the fact that it is pretty high mileage.",
8438,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,I'm not sure what you mean. The price it is listed at is $8900. I can negotiate the price a bit though if you are able to pick it up right away.,
8439,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"I am sorry, I meant 6000. I can come get it today with cash in hand for 6230. How does that sound?",
8440,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,Hmmm that's really low...,
8441,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Not really, the pickup is almost 13 years old and the high mileage means that I am bound to have some engine problems not too long after buying it.",
8442,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"The engine was rebuilt and is in good condition, you shouldn't have any problems with it. It is a great truck and has many good years left on her. If we were talking about a car just for tooling around yeah it might be high but for a truck that can haul what this truck can, you won't find a better deal out there.",
8443,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Still, the wear and tear is there. I with just a 4.8 Liter engine I doubt how much hauling it can really do. I can do 7000, but that is it.",
8444,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"Alright, $7000 is a fair compromise, I can do that.",
8445,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,"Hi there , I am wondering what is the current status on smoking?",
8446,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,id prefer if you didnt smoke inside,
8447,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,"I don't, I just want to make sure it is non smoking...",
8448,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,you have nothing to fear then! this property has been smoke free since it was built,
8449,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,"Great, next question is do you have a pet policy?",
8450,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,"yes, unfortunately we do not allow pets unless they are support animals with the proper paper work",
8451,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,I have a goldfish named bob.. is he okay?,
8452,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,i may be able to look the other way for bob,
8453,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,"Thanks! I was hoping to pay 3195, is that a possibility as well?",
8454,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,"well, we just recently renovated the house, you should see the new kitchen. can you afford $3350?",
8455,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,I could do 3280?,
8456,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,1,"look, you seem nice and i would love to give bob this new place to call home. if you can do 3300 we have a deal.",
8457,C_c27f99ec25334339bb3a9d8a6aed4736,0,ok great,

8492,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,1,It works wonders if you want to limit the noise in the environment.,
8493,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,0,how long is the connecting cable?,
8494,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,1,"Not sure of the lenghts but two different sizes , one is quite long.",

8496,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,1,Yes and it is good for 5 more years,
8497,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,0,what are you asking for them?,
8498,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,1,$150.00,
8499,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,0,"Well, that's considerably more than budget will allow. I have seen some of them elsewhere at around $80. Would you take 90 for them?",
8500,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,1,They must be a different model because these are already a price cut at 150. I would come down to 125.,
8501,C_9cfd46adca92494fa63b1069d66c7547,0,"That's still higher than budget ... would you go for $105, including shipping cost?",

10167,C_4a04b6abe74e459a88ebc861a0c5a3ee,1,I would not be able to let it go that cheap considering what I paid for it originally and it was never used. This stand is solid and will last for many many years so you would get a lot of use out of it.,
10168,C_4a04b6abe74e459a88ebc861a0c5a3ee,0,"If I can get $10 more, how would $30 cash be?",
10169,C_4a04b6abe74e459a88ebc861a0c5a3ee,1,I will be willing to do that. You will have to pick it up though.,

10210,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,0,"10,000 on a 2006? that's really low mileage. Were you the only owner? Did you buy the truck new?",
10211,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,1,I bought the truck new and I am the owner. It is legit.,
10212,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,0,Ok well it looks like a great truck and really need something like this. However the price is a little over what I want to spend.... Is there anyway you would take $9000?,

10214,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,0,"If the truck is still under manufacture warranty? I'm mainly just concerned about the year, it's a 10 year old truck.",
10215,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,1,It is actually. No need to be concerned.,
10216,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,0,"Okay. $10,000 would work for me. Thank you.",
10217,C_1114700d66bb4a2ea312b83d5403ceed,1,Sounds good.,

10242,C_b8f2c9ab52cb41a9a919f4472a068e1a,1,I can go down to 400,
10243,C_b8f2c9ab52cb41a9a919f4472a068e1a,0,Slightly out of my budget can we meet at  360?,

10262,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,0,The lease price is a little high. Would you consider $4000?,
10263,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,1,Sure we could negotiate the price.  But we wouldn't be able to allow pets in that case.,
10264,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,0,That's fine. I have no pets.,

10269,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,1,"Great. If we reduce the price to $4000 you would need to do the pool maintenance yourself, would that be a problem?",
10270,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,0,"No, I could work with that no problem.",
10271,C_dec1fc32e38c423ea503fdde41508b58,1,Ok great.,

10299,C_a5cea64025a545139036f6fecfdde8ba,1,I was hoping to get a bit more out of it so that I can buy a new one. Can we do 85?,
10300,C_a5cea64025a545139036f6fecfdde8ba,0,Well if I do $85 can you possibly deliver?  It is a suprise for my husband and it would be great if I had it here when he gets home from work.,

10311,C_79851af1774248f197653e085fc306ad,1,"That's a pretty steep markdown. We're looking at a 3 piece sofa set, new, leather. That's definitely worth more than $500.",
10312,C_79851af1774248f197653e085fc306ad,0,How about 700 and I will pick it up myself?,

11581,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,Hello,
11582,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Hello. Beautiful car!,
11583,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,"Thanks, it is a great little car.",
11584,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,What's the milage on it?,
11585,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,It only has 15k miles on it. I only drive it on weekends.,
11586,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Are you the orignal owner?,
11587,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,"Yep, I'm the only owner and I've never let anyone else drive it. I've kept up on all the maintenance and have driven it very carefully.",
11588,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Why are you parting with it?,
11589,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,I got a brand new one.,
11590,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Nice! The price is a little steep for a 10 year old car and without warranty those german cars are expensive to work on.,
11591,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,Yeah if you don't have a good mechanic near you I guess that could be a problem. I've been lucky to have lots of great shops. I'm not in a hurry to sell it though.,
11592,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,How long is the warrranty on it?,
11593,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,I'm sure it is long expired. But I mean it is a Porshe. Not really a practical car.,
11594,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,For some it is. Would you take $40K for it?,
11595,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,No that is just way too low. This car is worth what I'm asking for it and I'm not in a hurry to sell it so I can't really justify such a low price. It's a great car in great condition. Has a Chrono sports pakage and full leather package. I can throw in the cover and a set of rims that I once bought for it but never swapped out on it. But I really can't lower the price that much.,
11596,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,If I was able to pick it up today would you go to $50K? I would also be paying in cash.,
11597,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,If you can pay in cash that is definitely a reasonable offer. I will be around today if you want to come check it out and give it a test drive.,
11598,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,0,Hi I was interested in your watch and was wondering if you could tell me a little about it?,

11600,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,0,Awesome I was hoping to pay a little less if you're willing?,
11601,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,1,"I need to sell, so I'll hear your offer.",

11603,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,1,I was hoping to get at least $100.,
11604,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,0,"Hmmm, Okay I really want the watch so I think I can afford that, send me the offer please.",
11605,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,1,can you come today and pay cash?,
11606,C_633af13696304c48985b84aa8876ac52,0,"Um yes, I think I can make it today just fine and yes I will be able to pay you in cash!",

11678,C_3ded45172e2741d2a39416f7b5985b1f,0,deal. So I'll pay $998 for 2 months?,

15844,C_d92cdc3ed72649a7b601ecf3a2dbc246,1,solid wood yes,
15845,C_d92cdc3ed72649a7b601ecf3a2dbc246,0,Have you had it long?,

15965,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,Hi there. Are you interested in the place?,

15968,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,How much are you looking to get for it?  It's near my new job and I'd love to be able to live close to my work.,
15969,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,"The listing price is $2025, and I was told by my boss not to go much lower than that. It was higher, but I talked him down.",
15970,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,That's cool.  $2025 is still more than I was wanting to spend.  Do you allow roomates/sub leasing?  That would help bring down the cost for me?,
15971,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,"Yes, you can use the other room as a bedroom. The place is big, so there is still a kitchen, dining and and a living room to hang out in.",
15972,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,Great.  Is there any wiggle room on the price?  Any chance I could do $1700/month for the first 6 months and then up to the full price of $2025 for the last 6 months?  That would give me time to find a rooomate.,
15973,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,1800 and we'll have a deal. I could give you a month to pay if you pay the deposit up front.,

16002,C_3fcf75559e8f4c3b8cf5220d8e74e10a,0,"Ahh ok I see. Before I buy it, can you send me the ESID on the phone? You don't have to give it to me now, but before I hand over the money I want to run a check to make sure it's not blacklisted or reported stolen or anything.",

16007,C_3fcf75559e8f4c3b8cf5220d8e74e10a,1,"The wireless headphones don't come with the phone, so I'm afraid not.",
16008,C_3fcf75559e8f4c3b8cf5220d8e74e10a,0,"Ouch, alright. That's the best I can do I'm afraid. I'll have to keep looking, but thank you for your time.",
16039,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,hello,

16044,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,"The lowest I would be willing to go on the antique solid wood set would be an even $600, and at that price it would be Pick Up Only. Original asking price was listed at $750, and the piece was picked up at an antique store for just shy of $2,000",
16045,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,"I underestand. But the value cant be near it anymore as you and i are currently talking about it at a fraction of the price. Im also interested in picking up the sofa i saw on the other listing as well. Would you consider 450 on the dresser, and if the sofa is in good condition, ill offer you the listing of $200. 2 for 1 deal.",
16046,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,I can toss in the sofa for an additional $50  (as opposed to asking price listed at $90) and deliver all of the items directly to you saving you a bit of gas and time for an even $700? :),

16211,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.,
16212,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",

16215,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?,
16216,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,
16217,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",
16218,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",

16379,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,That all sounds great it's just a little over my budget. Would you be willing to accept 1746 if i gave security deposit and 3 months rent upfront?,
16380,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,1,Well that is much lower than asking price. How long of a lease were you thinking of signing? If it were a short lease I think I could consider a price that low.,
16381,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,0,6 months,
16382,C_0855e5b1bdfc4c058a30a7a5bcd0e782,1,"For a 6 month lease, where you're putting up security plus 3 months I could definitely meet that price. However when that lease is up we would not be able to renew at that price.",

16396,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,"I'm pretty interested, but I'm not sure it's worth what you're asking",
16397,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,"Well the area is too good, and the apartment has been remodeled fully. I am open to negotiating though. What do you have in mind?",
16398,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,"I would be willing to pay $1100 and I can offer services around the apartment, like I will do basic repairs and yardwork.",
16399,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,Okay that sounds good but you will have to be working 30 hours around the apartment. Is that okay with you? to make up for the price?,
16400,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,0,30 hours a month? sure.,
16401,C_7679af9487b44f2dbd5b3b4cfc2f3284,1,Okay then we've got a deal! Thanks,

16460,C_5c4d4e8fa3054145a85371f2d51b2ec2,0,Can you lower the price at all for me?,
16461,C_5c4d4e8fa3054145a85371f2d51b2ec2,1,"I could take 100 off for you, it's a great neighborhood and location",

16465,C_5c4d4e8fa3054145a85371f2d51b2ec2,1,1500 is the lowest I can go,
16466,C_5c4d4e8fa3054145a85371f2d51b2ec2,0,That works,
16496,C_31432cfc8c5c4015a28f51f6ebc4e002,0,"Hi, I'm interested in your phone.",

18281,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,It sounds nice but some of the amenities aren't of any use to me and my preference isn't to be on the third floor. I have a little wiggle room but not a huge amount.,
18282,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,"Ok, how about if I'll pay the bills for you?",
18283,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,"Well, give me numbers. What type of numbers are we talking about?",
18284,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,How about $1600 and I'll pay the bills too..,
18285,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,"When you say bills what are you talking about? Just utilities? Electricity, water, gas?",
18286,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,electricity and water. We don't have gas. Good deal..,
18287,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,I'll do $1450 plus electricity and water.,
18288,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,Ok.. But you have to move in this month.,
18289,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,"Sure. My old lady just kicked me out anyway. $1450 it is, then.",
18290,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,Deal. Thanks,
18291,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,Deal. Thanks.,

19027,C_6101c92a22324346840c872077ed5734,1,It is the most fun and exciting adventure you can ever do. It make you feel like a kid all over again.,

20992,C_36d03cbc4c8645fbb8023831a0dfb15e,0,Hi there! I'm interested in your Highlander. Can you let me know what you're asking for it?,
20993,C_36d03cbc4c8645fbb8023831a0dfb15e,1,$17500. It is like new. No accidents and very clean,

21103,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,Hi there. Are you interested in the place?,

21108,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,That's cool. $2025 is still more than I was wanting to spend. Do you allow roomates/sub leasing? That would help bring down the cost for me?,

21110,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,Great. Is there any wiggle room on the price? Any chance I could do $1700/month for the first 6 months and then up to the full price of $2025 for the last 6 months? That would give me time to find a rooomate.,
21111,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,1800 and we'll have a deal. I could give you a month to pay if you pay the deposit up front.,
