1209,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,Probably 24.  It's just too big for my small wrist so that's why I'm selling it.,
1210,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,can you ship it to me,
1211,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,I can ship it to you if you pay what I'm asking for it.  $150,
1212,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,it sells list price for 150. I could just get it on amazon with free shipping for that price brand new,
1213,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,Well???,
1214,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,"well if you aren't willing to sell it less than list price for a used watch, then I don't think we can come to an agreement",

1216,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,I mean you need to get rid of the watch as it's currently useless to you. I'm willing to give you 130,
1217,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,I have to pay for shipping which I would naturally insure it for it's value so I'm firm on $150,
1218,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,You will never be able to sell it at the same price of a brand new watch. $138 is my final offer,

If you are really looking for a gift for your wife I might go down slightly, but in that case you will need to pick it up yourself. 600 dollars if you can pick it up yourself.",

1976,C_24248cf66eee4e48b618ce74ec00c8fb,1,"I am sorry but 2480 is very low for what you are getting back. There is a pool, fitness center, clubhouse, and lots of stuff that you're getting with it. I can give it to you for $2700 nothing lower than that",

2084,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,1,"Yes, utilities are included! Utilities include electrcity, water, and cable.",
2085,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,0,"Perfect, what is the average age of other students living in the apartment complex?",
2086,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,1,"Most of our residents are undergrads at Cal University, so the age can range from 18-24.",
2087,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,0,Awesome I'm actually 21 soooo that works.,
2088,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,1,You would fit in fine with our other residents!,
2089,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,0,"My only concern is that I have tight budget this semester because I'm not able to get my financial aid this semester from Cal State, I was really hoping to pay no more then $1800 for rent.",
2090,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,1,"Well at ABSW Apartments we know how finacilly tight some college students can be, so we actually offer $500 off monthly rent if you are willing to work at apartment complex. This work can include working in our leasing office to help keeping the grounds clean and even giving tours to potenital residents...would you be interested in this?",
2091,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,0,OMG I have been looking for a part time time job! This would be so perfect.,
2092,C_24fc25b893ca4fd3b593dcc1e75238d6,1,"Great! So that $1950 a month would actually become $1,450 a month. You must be able to work at least 20-25 hours a week, including weekends. We can go over the exact details when you come in to sign your paperwork.",
2139,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,Hello! Are you interested in the leather sofa?,
2140,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Yes, I might be. Are there any problems with the sofa?",
2141,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,Absolutely none! I've only owned it for one year and it is in absolutely pristine condition.,
2142,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, if it's in such great condition, why are you getting rid of it?",
2143,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"You see, I just got a new kitten for my daughter. They are absolutely inseparable! But this sofa is a (hard to come by) light grey Italian leather and the kitten unfortunately sheds a LOT. I just don't like how it looks in the living room anymore and it is difficult to keep hair-free. Not to worry, I'm having it professionally cleaned to remove all pet dander!",
2144,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, if this kitten is such a burden, I'd be glad to take it off your hands for $225.",
2145,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"Since it is being cleaned and it is a very high quality leather, much less in a rare shade of grey, I would be willing to take 325 for it.",
2146,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, now I'm interested in this kitten too. I'll tell you what, if you throw in the kitten, I'll take the sofa a $375.",
2147,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"Oh no no, I cannot part with the kitten. She is family. But she did come from a litter that still has kittens available from. She is a high quality breed. I can give you the contact info. The owner is a dear friend of mine and I can get her to give you an excellent deal on the kitten. I can take 300 for the sofa",
2148,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Okay, I'll take the sofa for $300.",

2201,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,1,ya sure,
2202,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,0,Please do,
2203,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,1,it is a hero 3 black edition with water proof case,
2204,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,0,"Sounds good, I can give you 100 for it.",
2205,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,1,not its too low,
2206,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,0,But it is used and the picture isn't very good and you aren't exactly selling me on the item...,
2207,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,1,"it is very clear in the picture, i also has a 8gb memory stick, i bought it for 200$, my final price is for 120$, i cant negotiate more than that",
2208,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,0,Ok that sounds like a fair price,
2209,C_759b07225d1b400da39e17768bb98119,1,yes thank you,
2210,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,how are you?,
2211,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,Good thank you. I would like to buy your truck.,
2212,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"Sounds good, make me an offer",
2213,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,Would you take $2000 for it?,
2214,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"I'm sorry, I can't go that low.  Can you come up a bit?",
2215,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,What about $2500?,
2216,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,I was hoping to get at least $3200 for it.,
2217,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,I can go up to $3000 and that would be my final offer.,
2218,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"I can do $3000, that seems fair.",
2219,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,"Ok, $3000 it is.",
2240,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Hello, are you looking to rent out my inlaw?",
2241,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,Yes. Would $900.00 be agreeable?,
2242,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"No, I'm afraid $900 would be far too low. This is in a very desirable area of Oakland, and it even comes with a shared on site laundry.",
2243,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,"Then, how about $1,000.00? I'm on a very strict budget, but I need something right away. I'm very quiet, I always pay on time and I have no pets.",
2244,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"That's closer, but I still think $1400 would be a more fair price. I forgot to mention another great benefit of this rental. Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)",
2245,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.,
2246,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",
2247,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,"If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.",
2248,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, I'll take that deal.",
2249,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,0,Agreed.,
2250,C_695bfd880612492b825d9bc4f38c0efb,1,"Okay, I look forward to practicing my poll dance moves to your music :)",
2261,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,I'm interested in your leather sofa. I think it would look great in my living room. Would you take $243?,
2262,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,1,"It is actually a sofa and loveseat, so I can't go that low.  They come from a smoke free and pet free home.  I could go $300",
2263,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,Is it soft?,
2264,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,1,Yes and very comfortable,
2265,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,"I have a bad back, so I don't want to sink down too far. Would you take $250?",
2266,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,1,You only came up $7?  I tell you what.  I will deliver it to you and $275 is the lowest I can go.,
2267,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,Does it clean easily?,
2268,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,1,"Yes, $275?",
2269,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,"Could you deliver it today? And could you put it in my house, please? I'm 85 years old.",
2270,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,1,"Yes, no problem, so $275 it is then",
2271,C_7541a3a7b64745bc9e5735cbb2f254bc,0,That'll be fine.,
2272,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,1,hello!,
2273,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,0,Hi! I'm interested in perhaps getting this bike for my son. What size is this bike?,
2274,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,1,"It's pretty small, good for maybe a 5-6 year old kid or someone just learning to ride, hence the training wheels",
2275,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,0,"My son is 5, so that would be good. Have you had any trouble with the brakes? The ad said they're only two years old.",
2276,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,1,"no, he out grew it quickly, the brakes are like new",
2277,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,0,Are the tires in good condition?,
2278,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,1,"very, he grew so quick, he barely used this thing",
2279,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,0,Could you take $15? I can come pick it up right away.,
2280,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,1,"sure, we want to gone, come and get it!",
2281,C_cae60a0d1a214a7ba20964d156f1eca4,0,Okay!,

2347,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,0,"Well, why are you selling it?",
2348,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,1,I am moving and bought new furniture and it doesnt match the color scheme anymore.,
2349,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,0,"Well, I guess if you can't use it any more, I'd be willing to offer $40 to take it off your hands.",
2350,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,1,"I appreciate the offer, but the chair is still basically brand new and I was looking for about $150 for it",
2351,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,0,$150? I wouldn't have even looked at your listing if it was over $100!,
2352,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,1,"I completely understand, it is 1 of a kind though. How about $95?",
2353,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,0,At $95 you'd have to throw in the trombone in the picture too. I'd be willing to meet you at $60.,
2354,C_12ef73255bca4d7787b1fc1e3a6f1227,1,I think I can meet at $60. Thanks for doing business.,

2536,C_34f3e14eed5044719ad8567e07a3bb5a,0,"Yes, this place has great features but 2200 would put a strain on my budget.  Would you be willing to accept 1195?",

2846,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"Hello, I'm interested in renting the apartment in your listing.",
2847,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,1,"yes it's a lovely place, nice neighbors and neighborhood, new carpeting, 2 bath and 2 huge bedrooms",
2848,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,Are there any problems with the apartment?,
2849,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,1,it's just too big,
2850,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"Well, I'm interested, but the list price is too high.",
2851,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,1,I could go to 2500 if that helps,
2852,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"Oh wow, I don't know. What I would like to pay is $1422. I couldn't even come close to $2500 unless there were some serious incentives.",
2853,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,1,"I could pay the utilities for you for a max 150 a month, sounds fair ? I will even reserve two parking spaces for you",
2854,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"Well, that's a lot closer, but I guess my problem is the area sounds really crowded. For example, right now I live in a very rural area, in fact if I see another person on an average day that's way too many people. I'm not even sure why I'm moving to California, since when the weather gets over 80 I get migraines :(",
2855,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,1,"yeah but it's not that crowded, I am sure you will like the summer breaze and the people are nice.",
2856,C_43fb8ddb579c49a09ae31420ba120062,0,"But they are Californians, and I'm philosophically opposed to the idea of California :(  Well, I guess the best I can offer would be $1600, I hope you can accept it.",
2867,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,"Cinnamon apartments, may I help you?",
2868,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Hi, I am very interested in the apartments you have for rent.",
2869,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,Will it be just for you or are you going to be moving in with someone else?,
2870,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,It would be me and my daughter she is 12.,
2871,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,Oh that's excellent. She'll love the neighborhood. I'm asking $2150 for a 2 bedroom with excellent light.,
2872,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"They sound really nice, are there any other amenities like a pool or anything like that?",
2873,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,"Yes we have a community pool for the tenants, it's right in the center of the building, where most places have a courtyard. There is also a small gym near the laundry room.",
2874,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Oh wow nice!  Being a single mom and all the rent is just a little high for me, is it negotiable at all?",
2875,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,Let's see what we can do. Where are you coming from? Has your daughter been enrolled in school yet?,
2876,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Yes we already live in the area, that's why I'd like to keep her in the same district and the location of the apartments is perfect. I could afford $1978 for rent if that is possible. I'd be willing to take a smaller unit.",
2877,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,"I'm sorry but I'll have to insist that you stay in a two bedroom. Those are the rules with children. It's very important to use all of the rooms as intended here at Cinnamon Apartments. However, you mentioned the pool earlier. Do you enjoy swimming?",
2878,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Yes we do. I would still like a 2 bedroom, but I'd be willing to do without the wall to wall closets and breakfast bar.",
2879,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,our only available units have both of those amenities. would you be willing to teach senior citizens water aerobics once a week?,
2880,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Sure, that sounds like something I could do.",
2881,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,great! I could tell you were into fitness. Yes we really need a leader for our troupe. We're called the Soaking Seniors and we haven't had a good workout in over a month! What can you pay again?,
2882,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,I can afford around $1978,
2883,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,1,"That's perfect, we have a deal. Let me know what day and time you are able to hold the class. If you can maintain it then your rent can stay at 1978. The Seniors eat supper at 7 and go to bed at 8:30 so no latenight classes!",
2884,C_a4a8b4b2db2f4a899733f307453a3a04,0,"Awesome, thank you!",
2930,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,0,Hello,

2932,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,0,"I saw your listing for the flip phone, and was interested in buying it from you. How much has it been used so far?",
2933,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,1,It has been previously used for only 3 weeks,
2934,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,0,"That is a reasonable amount of time, do you happen to have a headset or any devices for hands free capabilities to pair with it?",
2935,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,1,"It's like new, the use on the phone was minimal. The phone is equipped with push to talk (hands free) and accessories with the manual for the phone",
2936,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,0,"That sounds good, I'm willing to pay $30 for it, accessories included. Does this sound reasonable for you?",
2937,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,1,Accessories are included. Could you do $35? It's listed for $39 currently.,
2938,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,0,"I didn't want to pay too much for a new phone, so I was hoping $30 would be good for you. Would an extra $2 be alright with you?",
2939,C_444f5e011d624d5f98977b3a9ca9302c,1,"Sure, $32 is good with me.",

2944,C_651a57f692304d77948916038fd54f7f,0,yes i like the fact that it has a intercom security control and swimming pool,
2945,C_651a57f692304d77948916038fd54f7f,1,"Those have been really nice features including for the apartment. The swimming pool is open year round, with two guests allowed access with the apartment owner. The security control intercom has allowed me to easily let in my guests but what's also great about the apartment is there is a doorman present.",
2946,C_651a57f692304d77948916038fd54f7f,0,Cool so i'm on a bit of a buget i was wanting to know if i could get the very nice place for $1500,
2947,C_651a57f692304d77948916038fd54f7f,1,That is quite a bit lower than asking price. I can't go lower than $1850. The apartment has a lot of amenities included and is a very desired location.,
2948,C_651a57f692304d77948916038fd54f7f,0,"i really need to talk to my wife about this the place looks wonderful, woud you be willing to go for $1650",

3032,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,100 sq',
3033,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Wow, that's much smaller than I thought.  And it does not have a washer/dryer inside the unit?  Is it shared with the other people in the complex?",
3034,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Yes they are shared.  I am willing to lower the price a little, make me an offer",
3035,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Okay, will you take $900? 100 square feet is just much smaller than I anticipated but I guess I could squeeze my bed in there if you'll drop the price a bit.",
3036,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,I can go to about $1300 but that is probably my lowest.  The location is amazing,
3037,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Yes I see that the location is great, does that 100 square feet include the bathroom or is that additional square footage?",
3038,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Sorry, I meant the bathroom is 100 sq ft :)  total is about 500 sq ft",
3039,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,0,"Ohhh okay, that's much better.  I was a little concerned!  Okay, how about will you take $1200 for it and I will bring the money and ID to apply today?",
3040,C_a0e1d254bb0a4f94b5350ac10408cf19,1,"Sounds good, $1200",

3983,C_a85d50e268084b3eacb598fbb51afbb0,0,I was hoping to pay more like $85.,

4044,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"Do you have any questions? I can tell you that it has not been restored and the asking price is $135, but I am willing to negotiate.",
4045,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"Before we talk price, why wouldn't I want this, Whats wrong with it?",
4046,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this table. It has the expected wear and tear of it being perfectly vintage but other than that it's a beautiful table with smooth working drawers and a very sturdy base.,
4047,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,Why haven't you bothered restoring it?,
4048,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"To keep it as vintage as possible, and for the buyer to restore it as they want, should they see fit.",
4049,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"Well I really can't justify paying $135 for an old side table, I have a budget of $55, so I can do that if you deliver it.",
4050,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"That's quite the drop in price, especially for delivery. I think with delivery added I'll take $100 for it.",
4051,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,0,"I can do $80 and pick it up, meet you sort of in the middle there.",
4052,C_6643464adf02427b80cf0e4d99b59e52,1,"Well, I think we have a deal then. $100 it is, sir.",

4080,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,0,"What's the story behind the salvaged title? That seems like a pretty serious red flag. You're asking $4,700 for a pretty old car with a lot of miles on it.",
4081,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,1,It was just a little bump I got fixed up after the accident. I claimed it as a salvaged car for insurance purposes.,
4082,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,0,"I see. Well, considering the age and condition. Multiple owners, the salvaged title and all that... I could give you $3,000 for it.",
4083,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,1,"I don't know about that. It's a strong car, very dependable it's Japanese. The part's total to $4000 alone.",
4084,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,0,"Understood.  But based on the age and condition. I guess I could do $3,750 as my very best and final offer.",
4085,C_47da7bcc44fd4766bc688d9a1bf87336,1,"Look, I'll give you a week return policy and we'll make it $3,900. The extra $150 is your peace of mind and my garunentee you'll love the car.",

4742,C_12e9db14b98f4dd3ada65173f70c148a,0,"With a clean title and everything listed, I think I could settle at 5500 on a payment plan over a year. If we could make it 5300, I could pay straight cash.",
4743,C_12e9db14b98f4dd3ada65173f70c148a,1,"Okay, 5300 is fine.",
4744,C_12e9db14b98f4dd3ada65173f70c148a,0,Thank you so much!,
4818,C_1632beede2c849ddb215f06bac7f497e,0,Hey there. is the backup camera useful to you?,
4819,C_1632beede2c849ddb215f06bac7f497e,1,"This was my first car with a camera in it. I don't think I'll ever buy another car without it. When you get it, you think ""I'll never use that"" but then you come to rely on it more and more.",
4820,C_1632beede2c849ddb215f06bac7f497e,0,Huh. interesting. What's the mileage on the car?,
4821,C_1632beede2c849ddb215f06bac7f497e,1,"It's got just under 45,000 miles.",

4835,C_4a369f84a93d43af91bfed699aacce1c,0,"Good, would you take 2800? I would need a 13 month lease.",
4836,C_4a369f84a93d43af91bfed699aacce1c,1,"I am sorry its actually 4092,please tell me a close number",
4837,C_4a369f84a93d43af91bfed699aacce1c,0,"Well , the most I could do would be 3700.",

4839,C_4a369f84a93d43af91bfed699aacce1c,0,Ok sounds great I will be over to sign the lease.,
4876,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,Hello!,
4877,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,Are you interested in 6 Commodore Drive Unit C430?,
4878,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,"I am, but I was wondering if there was any chance of the price being negotiable.",
4879,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,"Hello, are you there?",
4880,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,I have a little wiggle room.,
4881,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,Computer froze up for a moment.,
4882,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,"I just live everything about it, but I am looking to pay below $2000.",
4883,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"Hm.  Well, remember that this is a 1 bedroom 1 bath in a fantastic area.",
4884,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,I understand that. This is the one place where I have been lookin for an apartment to become available.,
4885,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,It's also been renovated.  It has a great parking space that comes with the apartment.,
4886,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,Would you take $2000? It is only a little less than what you are asking.,
4887,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"What about $2100?  I think that's fair.  This does include a lot of luxuries, including community laundry rooms, heated pools, hot tubs, saunas, and a fitness center.",
4888,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,What do you think?,
4889,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,"Oh, I wasn't made aware of those amenities!!! If I fixed things up that need repairs would you take the $2000?",
4890,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,"That's still a little low.  Actually, the place has granite counter tops and gorgeous flooring in there already.  I'm still looking for $2100.",
4891,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,It is definitely over my original budget of under $1500 that I was looking for. I may need to keep looking even though this place is great.,
4892,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,I tell you what...let me see if we can do $2050.  What do you think?,
4893,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,I think I could do the extra $50. That seems fair.,
4894,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,1,Deal!,
4895,C_89ea3d69e875476eb4c73f9e45ab3193,0,Thank you for being considerate.,

4934,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,1,No defects. It's in great condition.  Yes the frame matches the table exactly,
4935,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,0,That's awesome. I see you have it listed for $70 but I see a few marks on the table. Would you be willing to accept $35?,
4936,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,1,35 is a bit low for 2 items.  How's 50?,
4937,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,0,Well I can't see the mirror so I'm taking your word on the condition. How about $45 for my good faith?,
4938,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,1,Make it 47 and we have a deal,
4939,C_ceed4eac3cdf4b4f84dee1c042364bd6,0,Okay. That sounds good to me,

4972,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,1,yes the 2nd bedroom is about 10x12,
4973,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,0,How far away from the school is it?,
4974,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,1,"It is walking distance from the school, a couple of blocks.",
4975,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,0,Would you be willing to go $2450?,
4976,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,1,I can go $2700 with furniture or $2500 without furniture.,
4977,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,0,I can do the 2500 if it comes with appliances in the kitchen at least.,
4978,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,1,I can make sure there is a refrigerator and stove for $2500.  The refrigerator and stove will be purchased and already installed before you move in.,
4979,C_847ea40f04ab4821b4c8df608ee58d9a,0,Sounds great.,
4991,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,0,Hi. How many miles are on this car?,
4992,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,1,65000 original miles. It has been well maintained and I have all the records.,
4993,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,0,"Great! Last week I saw a similar vehicle with 70000 miles for 14,500. So 20000 is too high for me. Would you be willing to take $15200?",
4994,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,1,"It comes with an extra transmission, radiator, fuel pump and I will warranty it for 10000 miles or 18 months whichever comes first.",
4995,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,0,"Ok. Are you willing to take $15500? I can have a buddy come with me to pick it up, so you don't have to worry about moving it anywhere.",
4996,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,1,I can't go that low. I could do 19000 but no extra transmission at that price.,
4997,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,0,"Ok. Since you want 19000 and I want 15500, let's meet in the middle and settle on 17250, with no extra transmission. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?",
4998,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,1,I'll go 17250 with no warranty and no extra transmission.,
4999,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,0,How about 18000 and include the warranty?,
5000,C_a4ca81848d9f48c69fc14efd59670f6d,1,Ok I'll do that.,
5021,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,0,I love the look of your chair! I have a couple of questions: What time period is the frame from? When was it reupholstered? Why are you getting rid of it?,
5022,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,1,"It's not too old maybe about 50 years or so, but it is hand made in the old european tradition. everything on it is original, sturdy well made no creaking. i'",
5023,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,0,What is the material on the back and cushion made of?,
5024,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,1,"chat misbehaved. sorry about that. i'm selling it because i don't need it anymore. and need some quick cash. as for the materials for the back and cushion, i don't really know, i think it might be double weaved cotton? Not sure.",
5025,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,0,"In looking at comps, and this being not as old as it appears, would you be willing to negotiate on the price? I am thinking $175. I will pick up and load myself",
5026,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,1,Sure but I can't go that low. The lowest I can go is about 300. I can deliver it for you,
5027,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,0,How about 250 if I come pick up?,
5028,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,1,tell you what. 275 and you got a deal,

5031,C_2d377d29fc514954b131abeb958c09c3,0,You betcha. Thanks!,
5046,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,So interested in this apartment?,

5048,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,I see what were you hoping for,
5049,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,"I really was hoping for $1500, but I don't know if that is actually realistic.",
5050,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,That would be too sharp of a drop unfortunately please understand this is a premium apartment i could manage 2500,
5051,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,I could do $2000.,
5052,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,going that low would significantly affect your security deposit amount but it is possible,
5053,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,What are you looking for in terms of a security deposit?,
5054,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,well on average with good credit we get 387 however lowering the rent that much may push you into a thousand,
5055,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,"I could go as high as $1200 on the security deposit, if the rent is $2000.",
5056,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,1,Well that sounds like we might have a deal,
5057,C_6fc746e283644c8eb29e09f596950e58,0,Ok. Good,
5097,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,Hello. I need to get rid of this item asap. Are you interested in it/,
5098,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Yes very much.Do you know how much it would cost to fix it?,
5099,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,"I think fixing it would cost $50, so I could subtract that from the asking price, if you'd like.",
5100,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Whats your bottom dollar on it?,
5101,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,"I'd like to sell it for $225. Or, I could do I could do it for $250 and deliver it to you tomorrow.",
5102,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Well I can come get it and getting it fixed should knock down the price too.How about 200?,
5103,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,You want 200 and I want 225. Let's meet in the middle at 212.50. We can say 212. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?,
5104,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,You couldn't let it go for 210?,
5105,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,1,I'm trying to meet in the middle with 212,
5106,C_88f5a934396f4b56bcf794b24328ea2c,0,Alright I'll talk to you tomorrow and come get it.The price seems fair enough for a one owner and non smoking.So 212?,

5136,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,1,Great! The amp is in mint condition. It even has  built in wifi and blue tooth,
5137,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,0,"nice, does it include the cords needed to hook it up?",
5138,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,1,it does include the cords to hook it up. It will come in its original box and accessories,
5139,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,0,Are you flexible on the price?,
5140,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,1,i am pretty firm at $949,
5141,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,0,"I was hoping you would accept $721 cash, and I would come to pick it up.",
5142,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,1,I can accept $721 if you pick it up with cash in hand tonight. But after tonight I won't go less than $900,
5143,C_8bcde152a6324703b0fc7ad86ef84011,0,"ok , that would be awesome for me, on a budget. I will bring the cash now!",
5171,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"Hi, what can I tell you about this bike? It's really cool and is vintage!",
5172,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,"Yes, I can see that!  Are all the parts original Schwinn?",
5173,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,Yes they are! They're in great condition too.,
5174,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,No rust?,
5175,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,No rust at all. It rides really smoothly and I've never had a problem with rusting in the 10 years I've owned the cruiser,
5176,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,What about the chain.  Has it ever been replaced or is it the original chain,
5177,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"No, it's the original!",
5178,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,I'm asking because we don't have a Schwinn store in the area and I hate to order parts online.,
5179,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,"The original makes it more vintage and classic, to be honest. Also, apologies-- I actually forgot to tell you the tires are new and they're Kendra, not Schwinn. But you'd want new tires anyways since new tires are what keep the cruiser riding smoothly. You wouldn't want tires from the 60s.",
5180,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,"Lol It was a good time, but yeah, you're right.  Ok, so what's the rock bottom price you would accept for this beauty?",
5181,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,I'd be willing to sell for $200.,
5182,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,Ouch!!  My budget is very tight and I want this bike soooooooo bad.  Would you be willing to accept 190?,
5183,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,1,Sure. $190 is fine.,
5184,C_433c05ee7f6148ec9d8607a90456b7a4,0,Great!,
5195,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,i'm motivated to sell. make an offer.,
5196,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Sounds like a plan! Do you have any questions about the table?,
5197,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,You're the buyer. I'm the seller. you have questions for me,
5198,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Yes my apologies! Is the table used?,
5199,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,Yes. It's used. But in a very nice condition still. sturdy and structurally sound. I say 100 is a good price,
5200,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,I would never pay the list price for a used table. How about $50?,
5201,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,it's an oak table. oak is an expensive wood because it's so dense and heavy. makes for great furniture wood. I'll go as low as 80 but that's about it.,
5202,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,"I will pay $70, under the condition that I will come and pick up the table! Is that ok with you? You wont have to pay for shipping or the cost of gas.",

5204,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Ok sounds like a plan! Will you polish it nicely for me?,
5205,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,1,"no, I won't polish it. it's sold as is",
5206,C_79e5ec3c33df4766afe3629526055b3a,0,Ok perfect! You are a great salesman. Thank you,

5266,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,What is your asking price?,
5267,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal",
5268,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,
5269,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no.",
5270,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,
5271,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,1,Exactly. Is $75 good?,
5272,C_9e5503d6553b4c7e8fef40743a5c0645,0,"Hm, well I was going to use that extra 2 dollars to buy my wife a very well deserved 10 year anniversary gift. However I think this lamp will make us both happier. I can't let it go. You have a deal!",

5407,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"Somewhat, but this is in amazing condition and it includes the case.",
5408,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,I actually have a case so I don't need or want the case. You can keep it and sell it separately.,
5409,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"Okay, without the case I would be asking $165.",
5410,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,This is a first gen model and only has 32GB. I would like to pay $75.,
5411,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,There is no way I can do that. I would be happy to take $150.,
5412,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,0,I just don't see that it is worth that. How about $100.,
5413,C_622ae8307ea64db49da110d928266dc0,1,"I would be willing to meet you in the middle, but I cannot take a penny under $125.",

5456,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,Sure does! I didn't really use it much. I've only had it for a few months.,
5457,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,What are you asking for it?,
5458,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,"Well, they retail for around $379. It is slightly used so I'm asking for $130",

5460,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,Yes. The $130 includes shipping!,
5461,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,I will pay you 98 for it and I will come pick it up.  Since it doesn't come with a warranty I dont want to risk paying to much.,
5462,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,"Hmm, 98 is a bit too low for me. I'm looking to get back some of my money here. The item is basically brand new. How about $120?",
5463,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,0,will you throw in a warranty with it?,
5464,C_36d9137d77e14cc187db74c0da5f1024,1,It's still under warranty. I've only had it for 3 months and I believe the warranty is good for 2 years.,

5525,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,Rent is $1595 a month. Utilities are not included.,
5526,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,Are you able to go any lower?  The comps around the neighboorhood are cheaper than this price.,
5527,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,"We can offer you a discount of $100/mo if you can sign 1 year lease, providing that your application is approved.",
5528,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,Would you be willing to accept 1395 if I signed a 2 year lease?,
5529,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,1,"Sorry, right now we can only offer the $100 discount. Remember we do the maintenance, including landscapes. That alone adds value to your lease.",
5530,C_ad1eff4ffacb430ba65206efd60afb25,0,"Ok, well I think 1395 is a fair deal if you will be able to pay for half the utilities.  That is my last offer, take it or leave it.",

5714,C_a434278bd1674887908121ea44fd5cdf,1,"It's only 5 years old, it's in great condition. The only thing you have to worry about is a slight bit of rust in the corners, but that should come off with some elbow grease.",
5715,C_a434278bd1674887908121ea44fd5cdf,0,"Okay, would you say the amp works perfectly?",
5716,C_a434278bd1674887908121ea44fd5cdf,1,"Yes, it's extremely loud. I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?",
5717,C_a434278bd1674887908121ea44fd5cdf,0,I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.,
5718,C_a434278bd1674887908121ea44fd5cdf,1,"Well, you'd have to pick it up if I went anything below $37, which I don't think I can do.",

5766,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,Are there any swimming pools? Any utilities included in the monthly price? How new is the unit?,
5767,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,No pools but we have a fitness center and we are close to a lot of entertainment venues. We have a pet spa and a fire pit for get together and of course the maintenance of all these amenities is included in the price,
5768,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,Is there any utilities included? How new is the unit? These were not answered in your above answer.,
5769,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,No utilities and the unit is only in its 5 th year however all appliances are upgrades and so are the fixtures so I can promise a fairly low utility bill in relation to your utility usage,
5770,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"The monthly price is a bit steep, are you able to negotiate?",
5771,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,You know what normally i would say no but im gonna go talk to my manager and see what he say give me a few,

5773,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,Oh my God this never happens my. Manager is willing to waive your application fee and take ten dollars off your monthly rent with the first month free meaning you'll only have to pay 936 per month I swear this never happens and I have no idea what's gotten into him.,
5774,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"While that is a great deal, is there anyway he would go to $800 a month with all the above terms. I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.",
5775,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off. I think with his current mood  i could get him to 926 and throw in a key to the gym,
5776,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,Do you think that you could talk him into $850?,
5777,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,no and.  I dont want to bother him too much or else his mood may go bad,
5778,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"Awe, that is still pretty steep.",
5779,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,Give me another few mins ill grill him a little more,
5780,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"Okay, thank you. I really hope you can get him down more. Like I said, I would be a long term renter and I pay on time every month.",
5781,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,ok so I spoke to him and he got a little annoyed but that may have worked in your favor he said 900 and that's it final offer,
5782,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,0,"Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?",
5783,C_e0f48b71717749bfbae94fda8ace627b,1,Why of course and i promise as soon as you move in you will see the value of the place,

5801,C_d616e26157ed4cd8ae4a7a87fa52c326,1,"No, it was only used locally and for short trips to beach or mountains.",

5808,C_ccac97cb8815439fb865fc370e80b23c,0,"WHen you say no check engine light, do you mean there IS no check indicator or it doesn't work?",

5899,C_1816351db251460895c4b7b1747c2b45,1,"Understood, but that's pretty far below what we paid for it and I know the sofa alone is worth more than $600.",
5900,C_1816351db251460895c4b7b1747c2b45,0,Ok I understand that is a low offer but the condition does not look that great. how about $750,
5901,C_1816351db251460895c4b7b1747c2b45,1,The condition is actually very good. The set has been in a smoke free home and has seen very little wear from use.  I could go to $1100.,
5902,C_1816351db251460895c4b7b1747c2b45,0,that is still quite high can we agree on $1000,

5906,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,Yes it is.,
5907,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,0,The picture isn't visible. Can you tell me what color it is?,
5908,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,"Yes, I'm not sure why the picture isn't visible. The box is stained in a redwood semi transparent stain.",
5909,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,0,Cool. Did you build it?,
5910,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,"Yes, it is a custom design. I did have help with the fabrication.",

5912,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,No damage at all it is still mint.,
5913,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,0,Sounds like it might work for me though I was looking for something a little bigger. How $25?,
5914,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,I'd really like to get at least 45 for it. It is in mint condition. I can deliver it wherever you like.,
5915,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,0,No problem picking it up if you are nearby. I'd go that high only if you included on eof the Alpines. I can go $30 if you help install it in my car.,
5916,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,"I would be willing to do that, so long as you pick it up. I can help you install. 30$ will work.",

5974,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,Hello,
5975,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Hello!,
5976,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,You looking to but,
5977,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,The bike looks great. Do you know how new the tires are?,
5978,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,I replaced them about a year ago.,
5979,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Do you know how many miles are on them?,
5980,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,They just sat there. I'd guess 10-20 at the most.,
5981,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,Hmmm...Just sitting there isn't good for a bike. That makese me a bit nervous. I'm happy to offer $150 for this without any new tires on them.,
5982,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,"That's too low for me, how about $180?",
5983,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,0,$180 is a bit high for me but I could settle at $175 in as-is condition,
5984,C_f5b79781041b48bdb8f859ad6403b8a3,1,"That'd work, better than having it just sit and riot.",
5985,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,I was wondering if the binoculars were still available?,
5986,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,What can you SEE paying for these great binocs?,
5987,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,Would these be ok for looking at my neighbors? I think those kids are up to no good.,
5988,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,Yes and you can even hook up to wifi and works in night too,
5989,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,"This sounds perfect. I would like to offer $250. I'd love to offer more, but those kids stole my money.",
5990,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,could you do $380?,
5991,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,"Not really, I could probably come up to 275?",
5992,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,how about $300 and we have a deal? You can take a pic of those snot nosed brats and nail them!,
5993,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,I'll pay $300 if you can show me how to use them.,
5994,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,great!,
6041,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"HI, I was interested in the apartment",
6042,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,"excellent it has 2 rooms and 1 and a half bathrooms. got everything stove, refrigerator dishwasher and garbage disposal",

6047,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,the rent is 1800,
6048,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"well, I wasn't looking for something quite that high, could it be closer to 1700?",
6049,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,1800 is final but look at it this way. I will pay for the water. so no water bill for you. this is a lot of savings for you,
6050,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"true, its good not to have that bill,but I wasnt looking to spend that much a month, is there no way to lower the monthly a little?",
6051,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,"did i mention your laudry is on site? haha very well 1700$ is fine. do remember that no animals, or smoking is allowed. no exceptions",
6052,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,0,"Clean clothes is a good thing ;-) I understand the rules, they make sense! Thank you, I will take the place for 1700",
6053,C_e6e08f5315f54998b78fbed290cf9a16,1,excellent,
6076,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,Hello how can I help you?,
6077,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,I'm interested in purchasing the sub box.,
6078,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,Sure!,
6079,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,What's the best price you can give me for it?,
6080,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,I am taking it out for $50. I can give it to you for $45. This costed me more than what I expected to be made. They're custom molded around the latch and the inside of the tailgate. The box is going to fit in most vehicles universally.,
6081,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,How about $20?,
6082,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,That's too low. The last I can do is $40,
6083,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,$25?,
6084,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,I can do $40 last,
6085,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,$30?,
6086,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,$40 is last,
6087,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,I'll have to think about it some more then.,
6088,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,1,"Tell you what, I can give it to you for $35 but then you will have to come pick it up! I wouldn't be able to deliver it ti you.",
6089,C_004ae9e50f4a4e2d8822823056edaf1e,0,Sure that's fine.,
6101,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,Hello! I am very much interested in purchasing this bike. Do you have it only in blue color?,
6102,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,"Yes, I only have to one bike and it is blue. It was recently painted so there are no defects in the paint",
6103,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",
6104,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.,
6105,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,
6106,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.,
6107,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,
6108,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.,
6109,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,I cannot go beyond $150.,
6110,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties.",
6111,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,0,How about $180 and I can come get it from you right away?,
6112,C_4bbe2efb6ef64317ad5ca9e50ec8715a,1,Ok. for $180 that would work.,

6267,C_56edad8934404a36acd35e206066478c,0,i want to pay 150 dollars for it,
6268,C_56edad8934404a36acd35e206066478c,1,"I can't do that, 200 at least",
6269,C_56edad8934404a36acd35e206066478c,0,it is a rather nice piece. I can come closer to you how about 185?,
6270,C_56edad8934404a36acd35e206066478c,1,"This is priceless to my family. I'm going to offer 200, and I will not budge lower than that.",
6271,C_56edad8934404a36acd35e206066478c,0,"well that is just a nudge to high, can you get it close to my house?",

6340,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,1,"It is quite small inside, but very cute. The floors are harwood. And it is in very nice condition.",
6341,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,0,How small is it exactly? What's the square footage?,
6342,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,1,"I'm actually not sure what the square footage is sadly. It just has two bedrooms, a bath, and it also has a guest cottage in the back.",
6343,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,0,Okay well I see similar properties going for much less near that address. Can you negotiate the price?,
6344,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,1,I would be able to go lower just not a huge amount.,
6345,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,0,Can you do 2000? That's the market price right now in that neighborhood.,
6346,C_9385669a4e7245f4b2ec4afa811cc4b1,1,That is a little too low for me. I'd be willing to go down to 2500.,

6368,C_932458353b8f47038c49c41b05e5a7b6,1,Guess what? It's your lucky day. That's the lowest I am offered to go. Would you like to move in at 1500 a month? It is a one year lease term. Is that possible for you?,

6448,C_fb33b29d25424ac19bb6f83c4ad471c0,0,"Well, then I suppose I'd be willing to take them off your hands. I'd like to pay$216 for the binoculars.",

6472,C_f337ee1d1aa34e2fa2ad07bfad05bbfd,1,"This bed was rarely used, only as an overflow bed. We have since went with a new supplier so this is not necessary any longer. It is fully electric, so anyone who needs to move about can do so with ease.",

6478,C_f337ee1d1aa34e2fa2ad07bfad05bbfd,1,"There is a brand new mattress included with this bundle, can we do $1600?",

6604,C_1f50c4606e234f8f956bdf6356300ad6,0,Do  I have the wrong person? The listing is clearly a Vintage Trek 830 - MTB Mountain Bike Commuter.,
6605,C_1f50c4606e234f8f956bdf6356300ad6,1,I guess there is a mix-up. I am trying to rent out a beautiful apartment on Francisco.,

6702,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,Can you tell me about the apartment? 2450 seems quite a bit above the going rate in that neighboorhood. I was looking for closer to 1225,
6703,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,this is completely remodeled.  It is like new,
6704,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,"the pictures look great, but it still seems a bit pricey compared to other apartments in the area. I can do 1600, just because I like that building",

6706,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,"ummm. I don't know, it doesn't even have a washer/dryer. I would have to share with the neighbor. I could go up to 1900 if you put in a washer/dryer",
6707,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,2100 and the washer and dryer are yours,
6708,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,That is still way too high for the area. I'm pretty firm on the 1900. I have a great history as a renter with lots of referneces. I won't trash your place and pay my rent on time.,
6709,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,1,"ok, 2000",
6710,C_ff04ab3038b446e7b44c1a9a5d5fd6b4,0,How about 1950 and the washer and dryer. I think we could both be happy with that.,

6722,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,0,"Hi, I like your bike. It reminds me of one I used to own back in the day. I would jump it off ramps while rocking a TMNT t-shirt.",

6725,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,1,no rust but it needs a brake,
6726,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,0,"The asking price is fair, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to pay $150 for it. If you do the $150, I'll perform some awesome wheelies for you before I leave.",
6727,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,1,"it is 27 years old you can not find these anymore, how about $170",
6728,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,0,"You're right, those bikes are hard to come by. How about we meet in the middle and do $160?",

6732,C_79ba6587b9f44020894456ba6d32e485,0,Deal!,

7046,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,"I'm sorry, that's what I meant. I have a great single family house for rent that I think would be perfect for you.",
7047,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,But you don't know me,
7048,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,This house is perfect for everyone.,

7050,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,What price were you looking to pay?,
7051,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Free, I'm only kidding honey. Listen, I'm wondering if this community is diverse. I'm a single gay father, and I just divorced my wife. Are you still sure this place is perfect for anyone?",
7052,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,"Yes sir, this is a nice house for rent in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are two large master bedrooms and two other single bedrooms with a total of three bathrooms. The house is great for a small family.",
7053,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Right, but I'm not really in a family anymore. I will have my daughter occasionally, is it near schools?",
7054,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,It's easily walkable to schools.,
7055,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Oh that's nice. I work from home, I'm making a new business so I was thinking it could double as a place to work out of. I don't think with the divorce I will be able to pay what you want.",

7057,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,0,"Honey, everything is out of my price range. My wife is Christian. My daughter is 14 and not into having a gay father. Anyways, this house has what I need to be a responsible father in contemporary society. Maybe we could do a 6 month lease at one price and then negotiate further. I have immaculate credit.",
7058,C_1beef7b7229c44dc9ed12e86f49831e7,1,Sounds great. Make an offer.,

7149,C_25639cc19b604c2397702c0db8b1a22c,0,I think that is a little steep for something 2 years old. Would you take $250 if I came and got it?,

7348,C_739ddc7bd03d4b6bb412bb6d13d1ac84,1,Well we do have a special if you sign a 2 year lease we are offering $200 off your rent which would make it $2450.,

7578,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,It would be on the price we both agree upon.,
7579,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,"So then with the $500 off, how does $700 sound all together?",
7580,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,There is no way that would be possible.,
7581,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,Then can we work out a deal close to that? I can assure you that I can pay rent on time.,
7582,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,The lowest I'm authorized to go is 900. And that would be the flat monthly rent. The first month's rent would be 400 with the deduction.,
7583,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,0,"If I give you 900, could we settle free parking for my first month as well?",
7584,C_e19e5e433374478cab50c826389f9b59,1,Yes that can be done. So overall you'll be saving quite a lot. So 900 is good for you?,
7697,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,"Hello, are you interested in the unit?",
7698,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,0,Yes. How many rooms and baths?,
7699,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,"This is a two-bedroom, one bath.",
7700,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,0,Please tell me about the neighborhood and neighbors?,
7701,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,"The neighborhood is great. Most people are young professionals who keep business hours, and you'll find the community to be quiet and private. Lots of nearby shops.",
7702,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,0,Sounds good.  Is the $500 off move in special just for the first month or more?,
7703,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,The $500 move in special is just for the first month.,
7704,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,0,I'd be willing to pay 1375 if parking is included,
7705,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,"I'll go down to $1425 and include parking, as well as water.",
7706,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,0,sounds good! Thank you!,
7707,C_ec49904858b141a582000936a9d926d5,1,Thanks!,
7708,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,Hi.  I see you are interested in the one bedroom apartment for $2070 per month.,

7710,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,No.   It is not furnished but it has a new renovated kitchen with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances.,
7711,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,0,Is there a deposit?,
7712,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,The deposit is one month rent.,
7713,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,0,I've looked at other places similar to this for 1600.,
7714,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,This apartment is located in a more convenient location.  It is close to the shopping district in Pleasant Hill and Walnut Creek.  It is also very close to I-680 and Highway 24.  I am able to include an underground parking spot with this price.,
7715,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,0,I just visited a unit near hear with parking for 1800,
7716,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,I am willing to come down to $1900 and include parking.  It is a newly renovated apartment though with all new appliances.,
7717,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,0,Does this include the parking space?,
7718,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,1,Yes.  I will include parking with that price.,
7719,C_3d9ad1f598b842009d35673310ee3361,0,OK. I will take it. Thanks.,
7720,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,1,Hello.,
7721,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,0,Hi there!,
7722,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,1,Are you interested in my home that I have for sale?,
7723,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,0,"Yes, the home is in a great location and seems to fit my needs wonderfully.",
7724,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,1,Great!  The price is $3175.,
7725,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,0,I'd like to offer $2857. I need to factor in the fact that it is a more dated model and that it will need some updating on my end.,
7726,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,1,I understand what you are saying.  I could offer $2999.  Will that work.,
7727,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,0,$2899 is the highest I am willing to go.,
7728,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,1,$2899 sounds fine.  Deal!! Thank you.,
7729,C_2cb484a7d816432eaa4beed4c32d4349,0,Thank you.,
7768,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,hello,
7769,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,Hello. Are you interested in our services?,
7770,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,Yes I am,
7771,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,Ok. We charge $50 for unlocking and flashing phone devices.,
7772,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,That much. Are you willing to discount the price for first time customers,
7773,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,For first time customers we offer a price of $45 for the service.,
7774,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,That's still pretty steep..Hmm what about 35.00?,
7775,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,"Sorry, I can not go that low. The best I could do is $45 and have the device back to you within 30 minutes.",
7776,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,What other services do I get with 45.00?,
7777,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,There are no other services? We unlock and flash phones to remove them from the network--that's what we do.,
7778,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,If you are flashing my phone I still have to pay for first month service. You are not losing anything with 35.00. I still have to pay for first month service.,
7779,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,"I can make you a final offer of $45 to which you can accept or reject. Sorry, our prices are firm.",
7780,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,0,Do I get a free phone case with it? What about 40.00?,
7781,C_791f3e03ed2d49e4b4be61e6d0c117ca,1,I do not see us reaching an agreement here.,
7803,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Hey, is this car still available?",
7804,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,"Yes, it is!",
7805,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,Was this serviced at BMW and do you have the service records?,
7806,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,I have all the service records and they are all up to date.,
7807,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Perfect!  I do have to admit, I am a little concerned by the additional work though.  While it's appealing, I'm concerned about how it might affect the reliability.",
7808,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,I can guarantee that I have driven this car for about a year now and haven't had a single issue with it- the car runs perfectly and I have not had to conduct any repairs.,
7809,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Ok, that's good.  I feel that 45,000 is a bit high though.  Of course, I do understand that it is a 2016 and has industry standard mileage.  Would you consider coming down on the price some?",
7810,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,"The lowest I'm willing to drop it is 42,500. I've done some serious work to this car.",
7811,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Fair, but I go get a 2017 from a dealer for a little more than you're asking.  If I pick up the car and handle all of the paperwork would you consider 38000?",
7812,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,"38,000 just seems too low to me. I could do 41000 as long as you pay in cash, as well as picking up the car and taking care of all the paperwork yourself",
7813,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"I can do 40,000 cash, pick up and paperwork, but I'd expect the remainder of BMW's factory warranty to be transferred too.  Can we call that a deal?",
7814,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,1,Sounds good to me!,
7815,C_ef253be7f67246aeb381e87f8257591c,0,"Perfect, thanks!",
7855,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,Hi there! Is your vehicle still available?,
7856,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,1,"Yes, this absolutely gorgeous BMW is still available, but I'm certain it won't be for long!",
7857,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,Great! Is all of the paperwork up to date?,
7858,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,1,All paperwork is up to date and I have clean title in hand.,
7859,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,Sounds good. Would you be willing to pay for a background check if I make you an acceptable offer>,
7860,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,1,I have a Carfax report for it in my possession if that is what you are speaking of.,
7861,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,"Yes, that's right. I recently saw a similar model at a dealership for about 30,000 but yours looks better maintained, so I'm happy to make a higher offer for your car. How does 31,500 sound?",
7862,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,1,"According to Kelly Blue Book value, I have this car priced very close to the value.  Given the pristine condition, year, miles, etc. $31,500 is very low.  I will accept $43,000.  Even at this price, you are getting an awesome deal!",
7863,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,"What if I pick up the car myself? Could you do 35,000?",
7864,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,1,"Sorry, can't do it.",
7865,C_27b41c9f264d4cff91493e9cad772e17,0,"I'm sorry, it sounds like our budgets are just too far apart. Good luck with your sale!",
7966,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,Hi are you interested in the house?,
7967,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,Yes I'm interested. Can you tell me more about it? What is the square footage of the place and how many bed/bath?,
7968,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,It's about 2000 square feet and it has three rooms and two bathrooms.,
7969,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,Does it have freeway access?,
7970,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,Yes it is actually very close to freeway access.,
7971,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,"Great! My only issue then is with the pricing, are you open to negotiate or no?",
7972,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,I am open to some negotiating.,
7973,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,"Okay well I was thinking because of the location which isn't the best in town, how about we do 1500?",
7974,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,"$1,500 would be outrageously low and I cannot accept that offer. Can you come closer to 3000?",
7975,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,I'll do 2500 if utilities and internet are included in that monthly price and you waive the deposit.,
7976,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,"We cannot waive the deposit but $2,500 utilities included and we can make a deal today.",
7977,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,"Okay that would actually work for me, thanks!",
8003,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,1,Are you looking to rent my apartment?,
8004,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,0,"Wow, this looks like a great place!!",
8005,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,1,I was thinking $1725 because it is two bedroom and in a convenient area for commuting,
8006,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,0,Thats great! Those are both really attractive! What is it close to?,
8007,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,1,"it's close to all the downtown restaurants and stores, can you do $1700?",
8008,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,0,Awesome! But thats a lot. Can you lower it if I pay cash?,
8009,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,1,how low?,
8010,C_5d8caab324dd4bf1b8ffce60a431ed1e,0,1100,

8120,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,0,Are you willing to be flexible on the price?,
8121,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,1,"Not really, this is solid wood like new, not Ikea",
8122,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,0,"I ask because I've seen new solid wood tables for on sale for about $1,000.  For a used table, I would expect to pay at least a bit less.",
8123,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,1,They don't sell them like  this anymore with the 4 extensions leaves.   - also comes with glass top - that's rare,
8124,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,0,I did not realize from the ad that this also has a glass top.  Are you able to deliver the table across town?,
8125,C_e8458e2ae08f4808ab4c8a86e4830041,1,"Yes, the custom glass cut to fit game table size top would be difficult to transport unless have the kine Pick up truck  set up for that.  I can do that for you so don't break in transportation.",

8198,C_e96f95b056e44b9dbc498a574765e2a6,1,Yes it is absolutely in a good working condition and has no scratches or anything. It was always used with the cover and its as new.,

8200,C_e96f95b056e44b9dbc498a574765e2a6,1,Woah! That's too too low. I am selling it for 70$. I can go up to $65,
8201,C_e96f95b056e44b9dbc498a574765e2a6,0,I wouldn't have enough money left over for other things at that price. Could you take $40,

8235,C_5229dd451d3b4f69b7146e105889fdd6,1,"The car gets 27 MPG AVG in the city alone, so I'm not sure where your daughter will need to commute, but it won't cost her much. Also, the car is in great running condition.",

8239,C_5229dd451d3b4f69b7146e105889fdd6,1,"There isn't a whole lot of mileage on it, but I'll let you know for sure. The best I can do is $21,000.",

8249,C_79ecf5f983c149afb1fecd0317757917,1,Great! It is in superb condition. I've had it for about a year and I am a fairly light user.,
8250,C_79ecf5f983c149afb1fecd0317757917,0,It looks like it's in good condition. The only issue is that I really need a phone and I don't have $55 on my today. I was wondering if you'd be willing to negotiate on the price a little bit?,
8251,C_79ecf5f983c149afb1fecd0317757917,1,Depends what you have?,
8252,C_79ecf5f983c149afb1fecd0317757917,0,I'd really like to pay $45.,
8253,C_79ecf5f983c149afb1fecd0317757917,1,Why don't we go with the middle and call it at $50?,

8263,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,5 grand,
8264,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,That is ridiculous. I was thinking more around 1700 a month.,
8265,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Well that's what its worth you can ask city hall if you want they will say 5 grand,
8266,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"That is funny, because the original list price is only 2480.",
8267,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,"Yeah that's for rent to own, but you have to rent it to own it",
8268,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"I understand that. So if I wanted to do rent to own and I could set up a direct deposit, how about 1800 a month?",
8269,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,That's already low can you afford 2 grand,
8270,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,I'll split it at 1900. Is that enough?,
8271,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Makes me think you won't be able to pay rent u low ballin,
8272,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"That will not be a issue. I said we could set it up as a direct deposit, so obviously I am not worried about having the money. 1950 is my final offer.",
8273,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Okay I can agree on 1950 if you can find me a way besides Direct deposit that you can prove to me you'll be able to make rent every month,
8274,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,I'll get you a copy of my pay stubs. You will see how much I make.,
8275,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,How much u make a month? How long you been working and how much are your expenses every month?,
8276,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,0,"You will see it all on my pay stubs. I have never had a problem with rent or any other bills. I have excellent credit, but feel free to check that out too.",
8277,C_37a7355fc7dc45c099c3ff5f8744ca05,1,Okay we meet,
8364,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,"Hey, I'm interested in the house bu there seems to be some issues.",
8365,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,What issues do you have?,
8366,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,"Well first of all, I don't quite like how it's a row of rooms, there's no width to the house. There's little grass, and the place does not look wheelchair accessible.",
8367,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,"Well, you're definitely right on the money there. We do not have any kind of ramp or alternative method for handicapped people",
8368,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,"So due to all these problems, I'll have to ask you to come down to 1600.",
8369,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,I will not be able to bring it down that much,
8370,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,Well can you install a wheelchair ramp?,
8371,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,"We can install a wheelchair ramp, for sure, to ensure both the front and back entrances are wheelchair accessible",
8372,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,"Okay, so can you come down to $1900?",
8373,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,That would still be cutting the price in half; can't bring it down that much. The lowest we can bring it down to is $3000,
8374,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,0,"I can do $2600 but not any more, sorry.",
8375,C_e87af8c09c304945a00d4d9317328485,1,We can make $2600 work,
8434,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,Hello,
8435,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,Hi! I am interested in your truck. How is the paint?,
8436,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"Paint is great, not a single scratch or ding.",
8437,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Great! I would be willing to do 600, on account of the fact that it is pretty high mileage.",
8438,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,I'm not sure what you mean. The price it is listed at is $8900. I can negotiate the price a bit though if you are able to pick it up right away.,
8439,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"I am sorry, I meant 6000. I can come get it today with cash in hand for 6230. How does that sound?",
8440,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,Hmmm that's really low...,
8441,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Not really, the pickup is almost 13 years old and the high mileage means that I am bound to have some engine problems not too long after buying it.",
8442,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"The engine was rebuilt and is in good condition, you shouldn't have any problems with it. It is a great truck and has many good years left on her. If we were talking about a car just for tooling around yeah it might be high but for a truck that can haul what this truck can, you won't find a better deal out there.",
8443,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,0,"Still, the wear and tear is there. I with just a 4.8 Liter engine I doubt how much hauling it can really do. I can do 7000, but that is it.",
8444,C_31863aa23ae74cefa0e498f87851d92a,1,"Alright, $7000 is a fair compromise, I can do that.",

8527,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,0,Hello.  I'd like to buy the bike for 104.,
8528,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,1,"That is a little low for me, I am willing to come down slightly.",
8529,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,0,The most I will pay is 115.,
8530,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,1,well would you be willing to pick it up?,
8531,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,0,yes I will pick it up,
8532,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,1,I cannot include the helmet or pump at that price.. or you can have them if you can come up to 145,
8533,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,0,I don't want the helmet or the pump.  Just the bike.   115 okay?,
8534,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,1,120 if you can come get it and you have a deal.,
8535,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,0,I think 115 is a fair price as the one tire has cracks.   115 and I will pick up.,
8536,C_83bc091724584a03877e776d8636dbe6,1,"Sorry that is just too low for me, it was already a price cut at the listed 149.",

8566,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,0,It looks great. I can offer $20 for it.,
8567,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,1,Well I can't cut the price in half. It is in excellent working condition. Has a remote control and an adapter.  It is really worth far more than I'm asking for it.,
8568,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,0,How about $25?,
8569,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,1,"Sorry, like I said it is worth more than I'm asking. I've already cut it down to $40 to get rid of it quickly.",
8570,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,0,"All I can afford is $30. If you live in my area, I could arrange to meet with you to pick it up(as opposed to you mailing it.).",
8571,C_c19861f677dc42b68832acf70f8aeceb,1,"I kind of feel like you've been wasting my time, and starting out with such a lowball offer half price, really kind of sitting wrong with me. I can do $35 and that's as long as I can go.",

8666,C_f991cac61421441a89a914a9b7aae350,1,The only way im going below $90 is with a trade added in. My asking price is $90 and i could buy at least 45 hoobastank CDs with that amount,

10855,C_dc99d0923cf74332a0e4eb8f832da0a9,0,Ok thanks for that. Lets discuss price. Im on a tight budget with the current vehicle i own. Im still trying to get rid of it. is there a better price we can negotiate partner?,

10860,C_dc99d0923cf74332a0e4eb8f832da0a9,1,"Hm, I was hoping to get a little more for it seeing as it's in such good condition.  Would you be able to come up to $13,000?  I think you'll have a hard time finding another car this immaculate for such a good deal.",

10864,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,"Its a great mattress for a queen bed. its an x-firm mattress, box spring and has a frame. I got it but don't need it to use anymore. So trying to get rid of it. I am selling it for $275 as listed",
10865,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Are those stains and dirt in the photo or is that just the pattern?,
10866,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,No its all pattern. I haven't really used it. Its as new.,
10867,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Ok. Was it used with a mattress cover?,
10868,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,Yes it was,
10869,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Ok that all sounds pretty good. Since it's still a used mattress and not a new one I was hoping you could go a bit lower on the price though.,
10870,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,I can give it to you for $250,
10871,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Hmmm my budget for a mattress is not really that high to begin with and it is a used mattress. I was hoping to pay about $135,
10872,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,Woah that's too too low. I am sorry I can't go that low. The last I can do it $200,
10873,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Well like I said it is a used mattress and I am taking quite a risk that it doesn't already have bed bugs or some other issue.,
10874,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,1,Well there is no such issue. I can give you the cover as well with it if you're interested.,
10875,C_553e6c6e6074402abc331405dd9f8465,0,Well if the mattress is already used I would definitely at least have to buy a new cover. If the mattress is contaminated then the cover that was being used on it would be too. If I come and pick it up right away and pay in cash could you do $150?,
10876,C_a2190e81da20405895ed8f56046b6b98,0,Hello,

10884,C_a2190e81da20405895ed8f56046b6b98,0,How bout 400 less? I would like to pay 2500 for it.,
10885,C_a2190e81da20405895ed8f56046b6b98,1,how about we meet in between and lets say $2600,

12249,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion.  You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,
12250,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,Great. What brand is it?,
12251,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand.  I'm asking $949 which is below market.,
12252,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",
12253,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Oh my.  That's lower than I anticipated.  How about $900?  Would that work?  I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,
12254,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",
12255,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you.  How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",
12256,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",

12317,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,Awesome! Are any utilities included like cable or electric?,
12318,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.,
12319,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",
12320,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Municipal city water.,
12321,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"I know you're asking for $2750, but would you be able to come down closer to $1900?",
12322,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?,
12323,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,
12324,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",
12325,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",
12326,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Excellent. Feel free to call the head office if there is anything else you would need. Enjoy your stay with us!,
12327,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Hi how are you?,
12328,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Hello....Thanks....I am doing good...How about you?,
12329,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Very well do you have any questions about the bike 150 is a very fair price!,
12330,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,"The bike is indeed good one...I just wanted to check about the wear and tear...on scale of 1-5 (5 being brand new), how would you rate it?",
12331,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,I would give it a solid 4 my son did learn to ride on it so there is SOME evidence of use but very little.,
12332,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Thats great...and how old is the bike in months?,
12333,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,14 months old,
12334,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Ok...I recently bought a second hand Mountain bike roughly an year old for my elder son and had to change the tyres as it was kept in snow,
12335,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Ah that is not a problem at all the tires were replaced 3 months ago!,
12336,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,You had to change the tyres within a year for a brand new bike? Anyways its good to know....would you consider $65 for it? I can pick it up...it may sound way less...but I saw few more in that band,
12337,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,No that is less than my asking price and a very unfair price for a bike of this quality i would consider 110 and i can drop it off whenever you like.,
12338,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Its still more than the budget and market price even if you take a modest 20% depreciation,
12339,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,The lowest i am willing to go is $100. Will you accept that?,
12340,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Lets settle in between....my 65 and your 110....that would be $87,
12341,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Sure if tha's all you are willing to do,

12365,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,
12366,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,
12367,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,
12368,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",
12369,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,
12370,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",
12371,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,
12372,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",
12373,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,
12374,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",

13198,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,as far as I know it does.  The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke.  My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,
13199,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,Can you get those screens repaired?,
13200,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,Yeah it does cost around $75 but the phone is worth around $200,
13201,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,"Oh cool, okay how much are you wanting to pay for the amp and the phone?",

13236,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"Hello, I am doing great. How are you? I am interested in the apartment on Bassett Dr. Is it still available?",

13239,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,"Yes we actually just remodeled it this past month so everything is brand new.  The location is perfect, it is a quiet residential neighboorhood but you are just a 5 minute walk from many local shops.",

13241,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half.  What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.,
13242,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,

13245,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Ok that sounds good.  These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095.  Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.,
13246,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"That sounds great, Thank you.",

15955,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,0,Hello I was interested in your 2011 fusion hybrid.,
15956,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,1,Hello. Great! It is a nice little car,
15957,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,0,"It looks fairly decent, does everything run well? It is a bit pricey for me at the moment. Would you be able to work with me on this price a bit?",
15958,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,1,"Yes, it is excellent condition with a few minor scratches. What do you have in mind?",
15959,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,0,I am searching in the ballpark of $5600. I dont know how feasible this would be for you. Maybe we could work out a deal.,
15960,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,1,Prehaps. I can do 6000.,
15961,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,0,I could work with 6000.00. When may I meet with you to finalize this?,
15962,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,1,Tomorrow afternoon,
15963,C_74c4b8d02b43482886c3455666f7a337,0,Great Ill see you then.,

16040,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,"Hi there, how we doing today?",
16041,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,Very good! yourself?,
16042,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,Doing great thank you for asking.  So you are interested in the solid oak wood antique vanity and dresser?,
16043,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,"I sure am! unlike you, im currently moving into a new place lol. Kind of on a budget at the moment. wondering what the lowest you would take would be.",
16044,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,"The lowest I would be willing to go on the antique solid wood set would be an even $600, and at that price it would be Pick Up Only. Original asking price was listed at $750, and the piece was picked up at an antique store for just shy of $2,000",
16045,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,"I underestand. But the value cant be near it anymore as you and i are currently talking about it at a fraction of the price. Im also interested in picking up the sofa i saw on the other listing as well. Would you consider 450 on the dresser, and if the sofa is in good condition, ill offer you the listing of $200. 2 for 1 deal.",
16046,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,1,I can toss in the sofa for an additional $50  (as opposed to asking price listed at $90) and deliver all of the items directly to you saving you a bit of gas and time for an even $700? :),
16047,C_6e89a9fc8ae146b4ac7a9760f2cad836,0,Deal!,
16102,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Hello! Looks like you're in the market for an amplifier!,
16103,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Hi, can you tell me how long youu have had the amplifier?",
16104,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"I've had it a year or so. We got another one and although we could still use this, we don't need two.",
16105,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,That makes sense. What kind of accessories come with it?,
16106,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,You'll be set -- it comes with an analog to HDMI conversion. You'll be able to connect to just about any network.,
16107,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,Great. What brand is it?,
16108,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand. I'm asking $949 which is below market.,
16109,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",
16110,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Oh my. That's lower than I anticipated. How about $900? Would that work? I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.,
16111,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?",
16112,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you. How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?",
16113,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575",
16114,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,"If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal.",
16115,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,0,"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",
16116,C_d29e35334fea4fccbb5e9fe492b6f339,1,Sounds Great!,
16207,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,"Hey there, I saw that you were interested in the apartment!",
16208,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Yes, it looks very nice. Is it furnished?",
16209,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,"It sure is, We just recently remodeled, and included some appliances. We have an AC unit, a fridge, a stove, and a washer and dryer!",
16210,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,Awesome! Are any utilities included like cable or electric?,
16211,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.,
16212,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",
16213,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Municipal city water.,
16214,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"I know you're asking for $2750, but would you be able to come down closer to $1900?",
16215,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?,
16216,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,
16217,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit.",
16218,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,0,"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",
16219,C_a605830b4c1d44b7b0b8ed09140e3da7,1,Excellent. Feel free to call the head office if there is anything else you would need. Enjoy your stay with us!,
16220,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Hi how are you?,
16221,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Hello....Thanks....I am doing good...How about you?,
16222,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Very well do you have any questions about the bike 150 is a very fair price!,
16223,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,"The bike is indeed good one...I just wanted to check about the wear and tear...on scale of 1-5 (5 being brand new), how would you rate it?",
16224,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,I would give it a solid 4 my son did learn to ride on it so there is SOME evidence of use but very little.,
16225,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Thats great...and how old is the bike in months?,
16226,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,14 months old,
16227,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Ok...I recently bought a second hand Mountain bike roughly an year old for my elder son and had to change the tyres as it was kept in snow,
16228,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Ah that is not a problem at all the tires were replaced 3 months ago!,
16229,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,You had to change the tyres within a year for a brand new bike? Anyways its good to know....would you consider $65 for it? I can pick it up...it may sound way less...but I saw few more in that band,
16230,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,No that is less than my asking price and a very unfair price for a bike of this quality i would consider 110 and i can drop it off whenever you like.,
16231,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Its still more than the budget and market price even if you take a modest 20% depreciation,
16232,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,The lowest i am willing to go is $100. Will you accept that?,
16233,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Lets settle in between....my 65 and your 110....that would be $87,
16234,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Sure if tha's all you are willing to do,
16266,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"Hello, are you interested in my phone?",
16267,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Yes. Could you tell me why you are getting rid of it,
16268,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,I switched to AT&T and can't use the phone since it is for Verizon.,
16269,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Makes sense. So there is nothing actually wrong with the phone itself that I should know about?,
16270,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"No, absolutely nothing. It is in brand new condition. Even in the box with all the packaging, including the headphones and screen protector and everything. Never used.",
16271,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,Wow. As good as a deal this seems I need to work on getting the price closer to $200,
16272,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"Well I can't go anywhere that low, considering it's worth more than 400 as it is. I could maybe take 20$ and do 380.",
16273,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,I just can't afford that at this time. I could possibly get $300 if I cash in some coins but I don't have anything more than that.,
16274,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I'm sorry but I can't go that low. It still has the warranty and everything, it's never even been opened. You would be saving money buying it from me versus buying it from a company",
16275,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,0,That is true. Okay if you'll take 380 I'll get the money.,
16276,C_d809b9fb8c354c809ca1d829cb42bf55,1,"I can do that. No problem, still getting a killer deal ;)",

16644,C_083cf47df93d4a8c8029ae8c8cccc963,1,Tires were just replaced and it has new wheels everything is good to go.,
16645,C_083cf47df93d4a8c8029ae8c8cccc963,0,Sounds like it may be what I'm looking for. I have 6000 in cash I can give you today for it.,

16647,C_083cf47df93d4a8c8029ae8c8cccc963,0,Sounds like a good deal to me.,

16655,C_133afe20146f4e71ad64d696f372b30f,1,"I was asking 13,000 but 12,000 seems reasonable enough. Would you be able to pick it up in person?",
16656,C_133afe20146f4e71ad64d696f372b30f,0,Yes can pick it up today.,

16661,C_9b39e632d9cf4ce4b239c17c619700e1,0,Well I saw I've seen new ones selling for around 80$ would you be willing to come down in price,
16662,C_9b39e632d9cf4ce4b239c17c619700e1,1,I could go down to 60 if you are willing to pick it up.,
16663,C_9b39e632d9cf4ce4b239c17c619700e1,0,Well I was thinking $40 and I have no problem picking it up.,

17607,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,Would you be willing to come down on the price at all? Would you take $800?,
17608,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half. What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.,
17609,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,

17612,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,1,Ok that sounds good. These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095. Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.,
17613,C_26ab8ec2e5bc41c189f4004d19105014,0,"That sounds great, Thank you.",
