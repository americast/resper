Yeah I agree.	3
I would consider it.	3
Do you have any more information about it?	0
What kind of children's charities do you know about?	0
It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	3
how can i contact them	3
That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	3
i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	3
Great.	3
This is,URL??	0
There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.	6
go ahead :)	3
I'll certainly review it.	1
I'm sorry I meant $20	3
Is it a charity that you are interested in?	3
That is an incredible figure!!!	3
ok	3
Could you tell me more about the charity?	0
what is it abuot?	0
I will also tell others about this charity.	3
The exchange rate must be pretty good.	5
It was nice speaking with you! :)	3
Okay, that sounds reasonable	3
It sounds like it.	3
Any child that needs help deserves it.	3
yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause	3
I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	7
do you?	3
Sorry, no.	9
However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	3
that is so sad do you work for the foundation?	3
Yes, I know about Syria.	3
Sure is sad to see so many children in distress around the world.	3
Thank you for introducing me to another great charity that is trying to do good work.	3
Where can I go to send it?	0
What's their website address?	0
Children should be with their parents!!	3
What type of help do you provide to those poor families?	0
Most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	3
There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	3
What is their website?	0
Well, I already donae to other charities so I'm not sure.	8
Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.	8
How are you?	3
It was my pleasure	3
Oh, mine just says "children\'s charity" but does not mention any specifics.	3
It was nice chatting with you.	3
How does me saying I will donate fake money make a good impression for future hits.	3
I have seen a lot of commercials on TV for it.	3
Okay, please tell me about the charity.	0
I will donate 10 cents.	3
You too!	3
I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.	8
Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	0
I think I will donate to them today too.	3
Yes, But I donated about 0.20 cents.	3
How do i know if it's a legit organization	6
I glad we can help.	3
Iwork in an office setting as well, I guess we are to talk about childrens charity's.	3
Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	3
If so, how much do you give?	3
I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	1
I agree, Save the children foundation work with the children through out their lives to make sure they grow up in a safe environment and get a chance to succeed based on their website.	3
Let's both do .15 but split among Ronald McDonald and Save the Children!	8
Yes, I have	3
I suppose not.	3
He even made it through college.	3
support children in more development country?	0
They could use some of that money for school supplies.	3
Your work is appreciated	3
So after making a donation, I won't exactly see how the money I give will be used right?	3
That;s great!	3
I still know nothing about the charity and I\'m already a half hour into a 2 dollar HIT.	3
Do you?	3
I wish I could more but I am trying to pay my bills with what I make here.	7
That is awesome	3
There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket.	3
Ok.	3
I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.	7
You shouldtype the samething and if perhaps if you know anything about the charity, share it?	3
I hope you have a great day as well!	3
They sound like they are a legitimate organization.	3
Does this money that goes for donation stay here in the United States?	0
nope 1 is cool	3
they sound like a good charity to donate to	3
I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	6
I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.	3
I can afford $5.00	3
It does.	3
absolutely i will support them.	3
It feels good to make a difference if only for one child	3
That sounds like an amazing charity.	3
I do not only help the children but everybody who needs some help if this financial or moral help	8
So we should do that to make sure we and the charity get paid right?	3
Could you tell me more about this charity?	0
And you?	3
I think I could donate $5.00.	3
i would like to donate but i dont have a lot of money myself.	7
Nice!	3
Some don't give the money out like they are suppose to.	4
Alright I will donate.	3
great and you are you going to donate	3
They sound like an interesting charity.	3
Good, how are you?	3
Depending on the amountI will match your donation but ONLY if you answer the following question: How do you feel about the organizations work?	3
I think that's great!	3
Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	3
thank you.	3
Thank you for your time	3
Maybe I'll consider donating to them	2
Nope, mine doesn't maybe that was the point, to see if I would donate to just any charity. Still I always hope the money actually gets to them.	3
Sure I will donate 20 cents.	3
How are you?	3
That would be so sweet of them.	3
Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	0
How much money are you looking for?	3
I will look into it for sure and make a donation.	3
I have heard of Save the Children Fund.	3
Okay that sounds good but how much would a donation of that size be?	3
I think so.	3
That's amazing.	3
If did they amount was 0..	3
ok .60 firm this time	3
And you likewise to ask.	3
I also want to make sure my donations are not going into the pockets of money hungry CEO's.	6
One last question - are all members who help volunteer based?	0
Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	3
and where are you from?	3
I'll donate $0.50.	3
With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	8
I think i will make a donation of $2	3
What do they do?	0
Is it a well regulated agency?	0
I'm really glad to hear that.	3
Hi.	3
I don't believe they can actually do that haha	3
I could spread out donations.	3
do they take donations	6
I know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages.	6
yes i am are you?	3
Yeah, totally!	3
ok$1 it is	3
I would.	3
I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.	9
lol	3
this is a perfect charity organization , they do all kind of things to help others around the world.	3
since you are so into helping out kids	4
That is wonderful!	3
I'll donate $10	3
Yes, I've heard of it.	3
What countries have they been able to help?	0
Yes, As soon as i get enough money	1
I already did for some websites.	8
They are a great organization.	3
Yes, and I am sure they will appreciate and need it.	3
I'll donate the whole amount.	3
You?	3
will you also give some money today?	4
A dollar?	3
The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	3
I have an idea.	3
That is something I do not think about.	3
ok so we agreed on a price?	3
So what exactly do they do to help these kids to reunite with their parents?	0
That is a huge impact.	3
At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	8
That's interesting.	3
Are we attempting to agree on a donation amount?	3
i am from oakham	3
i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	3
ok how about 20 cents.	3
Is there any concrete proof that they do?	6
Every child deserves to have nutritious food.	3
How are you today?	3
I haven't.	3
im ok and you	3
Thank you.	3
Nice!!!	3
maybe i will do	2
I'd be glad to support the cause	3
For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	3
what happened?	3
I would like to know more about this charity	0
Or do they operate primarily in America?	0
Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.	3
Sure.	3
Thank you and have a great day	3
Makes sense you gotta keep the engine running.	3
yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	8
What other countries are they working in right now?	0
I do donate sometimes, yes.	3
o.k. 20 cents for now agreed and regular for 6 months, o.k.?	3
thank you.	3
What are some of the things that they do for the children?	0
I have a passion for helping children also.	3
do you donate to them?	4
And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	3
Ah ok very nice.	3
How much is a good donation?	3
However, I usually just give where I feel I need to and if people use it the wrong way, I believe they will get what's coming to them.	3
Right on so I will give $0.15:)	3
in all 50 states?	0
What do you like about them?	0
I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	3
yes im looking at it now actually it seems like a great foundation	3
hi i am fine..	3
That's good.	3
Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.	3
I am more willing to help a charity that will help right here in America	8
That seems so hard to believe, but I guess lots of pennies still add up!	3
Thank you!	3
No, not really.	3
I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	3
Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence	3
Cool no problem	3
that's great maybe we could both donate to them	3
It really sounds like a blessing!	3
What are the amounts for monthly subscriptions?	0
You do make a point.	3
I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics	3
There are so many charities that claim to do the same things.	3
That's wonderful!	3
this is so good.	3
I moved to the US and things are much better now	3
Sometimes I'm cautious of donating, just because I want to know that they're making the difference that they saw they are.	2
how are you?	3
very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children	8
I've been thinking of donating to charity, but I could never find the right one.	8
I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.	3
It's really cool.	3
However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	3
Yeah - all good things	3
How are you?	3
Hello	3
Oh, thanks for the website, I am sure that it has a lot of information that I could use to learn more about it.	3
I also have a child, so I understand where you're coming from.	3
right, well i feel horrible only saying $0 but i will say $0.00 because i want to go the website with my daughter and look it over and then donate there so she can be part of it	9
All we could do is our part since problem is so big.	3
do you do any volunteer work?	3
It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.	3
I feel very strongly about "our own children" !!	3
And thanks for helping!	3
I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	3
What if i'd like to donate more	3
Very true!	3
My wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	7
what is the website?	3
Every month I always try to donate a little to charity	8
Good morning.	3
Yes, I'm interested.	3
It was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.	6
Hello tell me something good	3
How would I donate directly from this task?	3
Good morning, I think children are so important and charities that involve them are needed and we should participate our money or our time.	3
Yes, I have!	3
i do like to donate to charities and this one sounds good because i want to help children but how do i know they are legit?	6
thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	3
How much do they recommend you donate?	3
That's a really good number considering the overhead that must be required for international relief.	3
I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	3
Yeah?	3
I can give $0.60 cents.	3
yeah I heard a little bit about on how children are suffering.	3
I think everyone kind of forgot that those affected still need help	3
How much money a year does save the children raise?	0
No i have not	3
Thank you.	3
yes I have two a boy and a girl.	3
okey.	3
no i am okay with this amount	3
I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	3
I'm not sure if I want to, but I can give a little.	2
I would like to donate half of my payment.	3
ok thank you sounds good,	3
Is there a follow up on to see how my money while little is may be is being put to use?	0
Would $1 help at all?	3
I have to make it more than 3 words	3
So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?	3
Simple Google search.	3
Hope you have lots of fun at the carnival!	3
Hey I'm fine.	3
I am pretty sure they do.	3
Haha.	3
What is the average donation amount that most donors contribute at one time?	0
thanks, same to you.	3
I know hunger is a big issue for a lot of people in other countries.	3
I then can see the money at work.	8
Hey, I'm doing great, how are you?	3
I'll donate a $1.	3
yes of course	3
I think it is a good organization.	4
I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.	8
okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	8
I was just looking through the morning mail.	3
How do YOU feel about the work this organization does?	4
Glad they are helping out	3
i hope the same for you also!	3
Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	3
yes, that is fine	3
Do the donations actually help the organization?	0
What charity are you involved in?	3
But I have money that I can donate.	3
30 dollars a month can change a child's life	3
What kind of things do they help with?	0
Yes.	3
No problem, what day is the charity meet up then?	3
That is very generous!	3
I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	3
There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	3
I feel really torn about the crisis.	3
I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.	8
Hi, i'm doing great! how are you?	3
How much are you donating?	4
How much am I allowed to donate?	3
Clear financial reports are a very good thing.	3
I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	3
ok so i will donate $25 to Breed the children right?	3
Man, the site sounds good.	3
I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	3
Hello there!	3
How much many are we talking and how you want me to pay	3
That seems worthwhile.	3
I have to get going.	3
could you name a couple of examples please?	3
Would you mind explaining what the charity does?	0
i would give it all if i weren't	3
No, I actually haven't .	3
Yes you are right, I help as much as I can.	3
Thats not my problem they have people in that country	4
If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?	3
What do we do about it?	3
I am not going to waste the reward.	9

Wow, that sounds really fun.	3

I agree with that.	3
Yeah I think its good to help any little bit you can.	3
Yes I do.	3
How much is a good donation that could help?	0
However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	4

I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam.	6
Well theres a charity called Skateistan that is championed by the famous skater Tony Hawk And the majority of their donations go to direct service and help children out all of the world whom live in the most vulnerable situations.	3
Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	7
Possibly, I'm not sure.	1
I have not heard of Save the Children before.	3
I love helping where I can.	3

I think it's great and I love that they help kids to reunite with their families.	3
me too..i see many commercials for charity on TV and it breaks my heart..	3
I've heard of Red Cross	8
I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	8
I completely agree with you.	3
i do very much yes	3
I have and I have heard good things about the charity.	3
I will gladly .	3
I am so sorry to hear about the little guy and how his birthday, too.	3
Fine how are you?	3
I have as well.	3
you're right, it is non-profit organisation.	3
Sure!	3
Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	3
I am doing fine.	3
I hope my donation helps a lot of people.	3
But I don't have money to donate.	7
are they buying new schoolls with this money, new books, clothes, shelter or is the president of the charity using my donation to get a mercedes benz?	0
It is going alright, thanks	3
I believe it could be true.	3
So, do we need to chat back and forth a few for times for this to be over?	3
What is the easier way?	3
Thanks for talking me thru this today!	3
that's good to hear.	3
Absolutely, they are the future generation and it's imperative that they are nurtured and looked after.	3
I will.	3

We could either donate money or our time.	3
I couldn't agree more.	3
I think I've seen their commercials.	6
How much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?	3
Pennies matter to me.	7
Have you ever donated to this organization and if so, how much?	4
Yes, let's donate $0.30 each.	3
How does that equate to reporting financial information?	5
I'm not certain if that's scripted or not but if it isn't there's a better way to word that and if it is I think the person who wrote it might need to retire because they clearly come from the 50s.	5
Hello	3
That is amazing.	3
Those are very good questions.	3
That's great.	3
Ok.	3
Very well, thank you.	3
That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	3
No I have not	3
Do they help adults?	0
Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	3
yes i could do that	3
I don't believe it.	6
Or do you also volunteer your time?	4
yes I have in going to donate	3
You also have a good day	3
wow no i did not	3
While im in the grave cause I didnt have enough money to buy that bag of chips....	7
are you going to donate too?	4
I have been scammed before.	7
You will as well for all the hard work you're putting towards this magnificent charity.	3
That is awesome.	3
Do you already donate to them?	3
i actually did but never had a chance to do so	3
Will you be doing so as well?	3
My mother and father both have a PhD so their jobs made possible for us to be able to cover all that and so much more	3
I will take the option of donating into consideration.	1
How do I do that?	3
I am willing to match your donation.	3
Are you going to donate?	3
You are pretty awesome yourself!	3
Unfortunately, I have to take care of my kids, too, and can't afford to help more.	7
How do you suppose we do that?	6
How much will you be donating?	3
OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	3
Yes I know.	3
I am really interested.	3
I've heard of them.	3
What is the womens name that founded it?	0
You too,was a pleasure!	3
They have a lot of information there.	3
Excellent.	3
Will you be donating?	3
Thank you Glad I was able to helpthis organization with my donation	3
we have to chat so ask a question	3
I think I would be willing to donate a portion.	3
Thats very beneficial.	3
You convinced me that it's a worthwhile charity.	3
what about you?	3
Where can I read more about this organization and possible give a donate?	0
Is this primarily in African and South America?	0
amassing!	3
5$ maybe, plus minus, why?	3
Hi I am fine and yourself?	3
I think we have a few turns to go	3
I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	3
Save the Children sounds like a good charity to me as well.	3
Is there another way to donate?/	3
I think I've heard of them, but aren't they religiously affiliated?	0
no this is my first time.	3
I wish you all luck in that.	3
I know of many that I do not support due to the 6 figure salaries of the CEO.	6
I'd do .15 with splitting	3
That is awesome then I will donate $1.	3
It feels like so little, but if a lot of people do just a little bit, it really adds up!	3
It takes a lot to fix this country already so your effort is definitely astounding.	3
sure would love to	3
Have you ever donated?	4
Children are our future.	3
i know it will	3
I don't really have anything to give right now, but I will donate at another time when I have steady income.	1
I don't mind helping those abroad.	3
Are you donating to them?	3
The kids dying is really disturbing.	3
yeah, i mean, i guess	3
Hi.	3
Do you donate to children's charities often?	3
Sure thing.	3
It would be more, but not without more research.	3
I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	9
I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.	7
Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	0
Great what about you?	3
The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.	3
I did actually, but i can't remember the.	3
That would be alright.	3
In Africia, Asia, etc.	0
Hello there	3
If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	4
I want the money to do with as I choose.	8
How is your day going so far?	3
Thanks.	3
How would I go about this?	3
I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	1
What makes them untrustworthy?	3
I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.	9
No, but i will definitely donate within next two months	1
That's wonderful.	3
Again not my issue	4
Thank you.	3
I am reviewing the site right now.	3
How did Save the Children help?	3
Yes, definitely.	3
Yes.	3
What is the purpose of the charity?	0
Do you know what these children are suffering from and what the money will be funding?	0

that's a fair point	3
I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs.	6
I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward.	3
What can you tell me about it?	3
yes i am.	3
Do they provide legal help or support to live?	0
It sounds familiar though.	3
How long have you been donating?	3

Children are the futere	3
How much of my donation goes to the kids	0

Would you mind telling me about it?	3
Nice!	3

good charity.	3
That sounds like a worthwhile cause.	3
I am interested.	3
You are welcome.	3
And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?	6
I usually like to donate to more local charities, this way it seems safer to actually go where it is needed and it is for poor homeless kids around my own area	8
Yea, hello.	3

oh so specifically in third world countries were they are mistreated or does it include first world countries as well?	3

Wow that is a lot of options.	3
Yes I have Heard	3
So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	3
I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	3
No I haven't.	3
It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate.	3
I feel bad about only giving $5, do you think we should give more?	0
I have an affinity for children.	3
That is amazing.	3
I agree, the local charities are good.	8

I suppose that is true.	3
Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it?	3
I do not do this "only" for the money, but to try and help any way I can.	3
I am sceptical of many of them but if you recommend Save The Children and I know that St Judd's is trustworthy, then that's where my money will go today	3
Okay, I will think about it.	3
it's a Monday, but a good start to the week!	3
okay done.. thanks	3
Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention	3
I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	8
Yes, For child care.	3
This is a worthy organization because many children receive some benefits	3
Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.	7

Hi there.	3
Thank you.	3

i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	3
Ill donate $0.30.	3
yeah sure, why not	3
We sponsor a child in El Salvador, we have been going it a number of years.	3
I saw a disheartening bstory on the news about some children that were injured due to that very violence.	3
I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	3
Do you know how much of the donation goes to the children?	0
I am so happy I can help.	3
The issue with children poverty has to change.	3
What about you?	4
You as well.	3
I accept your view and it is necessary that everyone should contribute at least to some extent to children's charity	3
I don't understand what you mean	3
I'm great.	3
it is an NGO, yes ofcourse many times I have considered to donate them as per my ability	3
Okay.	3
That'd be fantastic!	3
yes thats nice	3
money?	3
When was this charity started?	0
How much are you looking for?	3
I'm good, how are you?	3
I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	3
I see.	3
Like a one time donation of 100$ or so.	8
I don't know much about that charity all all.	3
I'd love to hear more.	3
What do you think?	4
Ok, sounds great!	3
Thank you For being able to be so kind hearted as well hope u have a great day and keep a smile on your face ;)	3
I think this is a fair percentage to have.	3
I believe in that	3
Not interested right now to do so.	9
i feel like i need to do something like that	3
I think it was from Save The Children.	3
Oh, I didnt know we could do another one?	3
I'd like more information, yes.	3
sure, I'll donate $0.05.....	3
such sweet creatures.	3
It seems like Syria seems to be a high stakes area.	3
ugh yeah, i've seen that, you sit there waiting forever for someone to type two words haha	3
Okay, that sounds great!Thanks!	3
interesting.	3
Thank you so much for your time and the effort you are putting towards this very reputable charity!!	3
There are some good ones and some that have turned out to be scams.	3
Are there different tiers for donations available?	0
I do for Boys & Girls Clubs of America	3
if you give 1 dollar i will also give 1 dollar	4
Sure, I'd love to hear what charity you participate in	3
Oh that's wonderful, what a great organization.	3
I have a soft spot for children in general.	3
That is freat!!	3
That is why i am asking you for the details.	3
What made you interested in this charity and not another one?	4
Fine.	3
Thank you!	3
Ok, I saw the website and I am willing to donate $10	3
If I donate, even a little, I want it to actually go towards what it should, not just lining the pockets of the CEO.	6
I also hate seeing children so helpless.	3
How much is the typical donation amount usually?	3
Oh wow, I would also be interested in donating to that.	3
That is appealing.	3
Well, I don't have much money right now.	7
Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	3
not my time anymore no...too busy	3
Oh that's great!	3
I've never been on an MTurk Hit like this.	3
If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	3
I am glad to help!	3
Thats program services not to the kids themselves.	6
You sure?	3
I have considered donating to St Jude also because they provide life saving medical care.	3
ok. than how is you family	3
I am lost.	3
You need to type faster.	3
Thank you for your donation!	3
I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.	8
I'm not sure how much I would be getting from the task, but I will say $1!	3
My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	3
It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	3
What do you do in the organization?	3
It sounds like fun.	3
he was in the end i think, this is the kind of things i have about our civilization , many dnt have to eat and many waste their food, its not right	3
I think it's 10 exchanges	3
I would like to help in the future when I am more financially stable.	7
All of my payment, the entire $2.	3
One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	3

I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.	7
Yes I know I will donate 5 dollars	3
Good morning, how are you?	3
so you have completely trust your money would go where you intend to?	6
I'm glad you understand my concern about scams.	3
Yes, I do	3
If I have a chance to donate when I'm a bit more financially stable, I will donate more.	1
I hope the money donated goes directly to them and not in the pockets of those running the organization.	3
That's encouraging.	3
Yes but that is a private issue between me and me, not you and me.	3
what would my donation go toward?	0
is $20 okay?	3
I don't	3
That sounds great.	3
It makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would I cope?	3
Thank you very much.	3
not so fast what does the money go to	0
I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	3

No, not really.	9
Ha ha.	3
Is there a minimum amount you need to donate?	0
Yes, but I don't know a lot about them.	3
Can you tell me about it?	0
We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	4
I would if I had at least $200 in my bank account.	7
It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	3
Wonderful.	3
I believe in this charity, but still wonder how much of the money I donate actually helps.	8

They help a lot of city kids.	3
i understad you	3
What about you?	3
Yes, I do.	3
I'm fine with staying at $0.50 as long as you are	3
I'm pretty poor.	7
They are helpless.	3

I am well.	3
What is the range of options?	3
What kind of children's charities do you think are the most important?	0
thanks!	3
I would be willing to donate to this organization.	3
Most of time we have to depend on someone to help them.	3
Is there like, an average donation or something?	3
Yes I don't mind if there is a feature I can turn on where every hit I do, a few cents go to the charity of my choice.	3
a few times	3

Where does the other money go?	0
what exactly happened to these children's?	0
I will have to take a look at the website.	1

I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	3
Have you ever donated to them?	3
I want to donate at least 50 dollar maximum would be 200 dollar.	3
i did only charity walks and rare to take the donations	3
that is very good to know	3
Good just another Monday how about yourself?	3
I haven't counted but we must be very close.	3
The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	3
Does Save the Children help find a place for refugees?	0
Yea, ive came across it a few times on different internet ads.	3
That way, you know what the money is being used for.	6
There are so many worthy causes that I try hard to make sure my meeker amounts go to benefit the most.	3

What about Big Brother, Big Sister, they are very much in need of donations	4
Do you donate to a specific child?	0
Just got back from the gym	3
Thank you too.	3
No problem.	3
I think it's because there are more people who have experienced injustice or have been hurt by inequality.	3
Thats good, I see they are ready to help out with the hurricane in Hawaii for the kids.	3
I would think it is very valuable	3
does it do any work in the USA?	0
I could give 5 more cents but that is all for now.	3
ok cool is there a website?	0
I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.	3
Right now, I think I can spare a penny. :)	3
Perhaps I could help out a little.	3
I am proud to be apart of helping them help others	3
Thank you for your guidance.	3
How long has Save the Children been around?	0
How are you?	3
I would donate $10 to this charity	3
I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	3
We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	3
Okay so are you trying to get me to donate?	3
North Carolina, I've been to Florida once, it's nice.	3
Yes, because it is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	3
What is your recommendation on how we can help	3
Have you ever heard of evangelism?	5

Yes that is correct	9
Could you QUICKLY tell me about it	0

Ok thats great.	3
I have donated to them in the past.	3
I would like to donate $10	3
I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?	0
That sounds like a worthwhile cause	3
That's nice.	3
donating money to them	3
It is in fact 10 or 5% of my weekly income.	3
I dealt with that more when I was working.	3
Maybe you could tell me more about this charity	3
This goes into a different fund.	9
Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?	0
How are you?	3
thank you.	3
No, to be honest I am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	3
What about you?	4
I pay money to the Royal National Institute for the Blind.	3

yes, sure sir	3
Hello, I am fine, how about you?	3
Sure, I will donate 10 cents	3

that sounds meaningful.	3
Especially if they are children.	3
Are we being selfish by keeping half?	3
I have never seen this organization help them.	8
Glad this worked out!	3
Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	3
maybe	3

Are you looking for a donation for the charity?	3
Can you tell me more about it?	0

That's right, thanks for showing me the page, I will help many children, today I want to sponsor 3	3
No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.	3
That is very true.	3
save the children is a good choice.	3
where are the children from?	0
Glad to help.	3
I feel that donating is an ethical reason to give your tithes and offerings	3
Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.	3
If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	3
What else can you tell me about the charity?	0
I agree.	3
Thanks for the info, guess I am skeptical.	3
Walks with the dog sound awesome.	3

I realize that	3
Right, but I would like to know specifically what organization.	0

Hello, yes I have but I am not sure what the charity works towards	0
That sounds good, thank you for being charitable.	3
What a great charity, is there anything I can do to help?	3
It's not a huge amount but unfortunately I have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	7
that is not bad I could probably do that.	3
Yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need !	3
What about helping children who are living in poverty in America.	4
5 percent i would donate	3
I'm surprised i've never heard about it! how do i know if it's legit and if money really go to help those kids	6

Thank you for the information.	3
I hear ya!	3
More about the charity?	3
I appreciate your position, but what exactly is Save the Children and how do I know that money will truly be used to help kids?	0
I would be okay with donating $0.10 from the task payment towards the charity.	3
What children organization?	3
Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	0
Wow .	3
oh thats great i would donate 5 dollars then	3

OK, i have donated to them before!!	3
Do you have the link to the site	0
It is horrifying, I could not even imagine.	3
I will donate 0.05 cents today.	3
I tend to read news articles from aboard. BBC, ect.	3
can't complain, youreslf?	3
Thank you for your recognition.	3
yes, I can do that.....	3
I think it is the least I could do.	3
Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.	3
That will have such a big impact on their lives.	3
No, I have never hear of it	3
Gotta feed the hungry first	3
I have heard of Save the Children but I'd rather keep my donations US-based	8
I have seen their adverts and campaigns.	3
i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?	4
Good point, I think I may consider it	2
Its paying me .30	3
Please explain to me in detail	3
We should donate money then.	3
I've been following the news about family separations very closely.	3
Just recovering from the long weekend.	3
I kind of saw some stuff about them on the news.	3
Its because I dont trust non profits	6
I donate to a lot of different causes but am happy to pitch in.	3
It depends on the way they see it.	3
Are findings tax deductible?	3
Do you usually donate?	3
That is amazing!	3
You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	3
I think I have...	3
I think they are a trustworthy organization.	3
3 dollars	3
How long have you been supporting this charity?	3
What are the donations used for?	0
What do you do for Save the Children?	3
I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	3
What do you have in mind?	4
It's not much, but I don't have much money.	7

i have three kids.	3

Really gets the public's interest.	3
Absolutely.	3
I guess in America you don't really understand what other countries go through.	3
o.k. task done	3
Yes, I believe it is good to be ethical.	3
Hi	3
If I can vouch for them, yes.	1
I've given to a few charities before, but never this one.	8
Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	8
That is a noble cause.	3
Is there a minimum to donate?	3
Alright that's cool so how does this charity take its donations.	0
Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	3
I will donate 10 cents	3
hello	3
I hope you still have a good week!	3
yes i am very much sure.	3
I am sure there are many ways to help	3
That would be the most convenient thing for me.	3
It was lovely chatting with you.	3
very fair, it is good that all contribute little to the help of children all over the world	3
I am from the Midwest.	3
Sounds good to me.	3
Give me your details i will send you later on.	3
What are they?	3
How are you?	3
This is good thing.	3
Yes children should have access to healthcare and basics needs	3
Sure.	3
Yes, I would love some information.	3
Save the Children has not convinced me they can work towards accomplishing those tasks.	6
Let's make a donation.	3
Not even a little!	3
I'll donate but not that much	3
It sounds familiar.	3
I'm glad to hear that.	3
How are you?	3
We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.	3
Great job!	3
And its awesome that you help out those kids in need	3
I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	3
that sounds expensive	7
However I am not getting a reward from this hit.	3
what other organizations?	5
They are?	3
Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	0
what hobbies do you like?	3
All the way in Africa.	3
I guess we're supposed to be talking about a children's charity..?	3
Do you agree?	3
This will be my first time donating to this organization so sorry if I have a lot of questions about it.	3
Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.	3
What kind of children does it help?	0
Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	7
I'm doing well, a little tired.	3
That is great that they are there helping.	3
I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	3
No, please tell me more.	0
It depends on the charity!	3
I'm fine how are you.	3
I took a look at the website.	3
How do you receive payments?	3
Great!	3
I admire your effort reaching to people to help the charity.	3
That sounds good.	3
What would you say is the amount of a the common donation thatsomeone like myself would donate.	3
how would i do it now	3
sure I can donate but what is the game?	3
What are some of your hobbies?	3
Sure, I will match your $0.50.	3
Do how much are you donating	4
this is nice.	3
I can't imagine how terrible it must be for a child to grow up inside a war zone.	3
I understand.	3
Well I hope that my $1.10 helps those poor children and when i dont need to rely on HITs for money i'd love to donate more.	3
I'm glad you are fighting for a cause to help others.	3
A lot of charities are just a name and they don't do what they promise.	6
Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	3
I know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive.	3
Lets leave it at that.	3
In what ways do they help children?	0
Great, so do we keep talking for like 4 more turns?	3
yes I know	3
I feel good about this.	3
Who runs the organization now?	0
You have a good day as well.	3
Oh wow.	3
Have a great weekend!	3
I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.	3
What are your donations used for?	0
How do they do that?	0
That sounds interesting.	3
Telling me where it goes really does nothing for me.	6
If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	0
Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	3
I know it's not a lot, but it's all I'm willing to afford today.	3
I am not sure yet. What is their website?	3
It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country	5
I dont see why I wouldn't	3
What kind of work do they do?	0
What is it about?	0
Yes, it will be nice to know that I was able to give to them.	3
I know the children are very grateful!	3
awesome, thank you so much	3
My family would just get through somehow.	3
ok $25 sounds ok	3
How long have you worked there?	3
I'd donate 50 cents of my payment.	3
Good luck to you	3
How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	6
HI there!	3
i think one dollar will help	3
How much do you think that I should give?	3
I agree.	3
We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations	3
I do like the satisfaction of doing good work for and towards others.	3
I think I would be able to donate some of my earnings.	3
I'll donate 10 cents.	3
I would like to donate 5 dollars.	3
Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.	3
Of course I am very interested to donate funds to charity	3
I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.	3
yes I have.	3
I am sure there are people who need it more than me	3
Okay sounds interesting.	3
I don't believe I have.	3
I am sure they do.	3
They definitely do.	3
The violence in Syria is one of the saddest things happening in the world today, as far as I know.	3
I spend a lot of time in the shelter for them too.	3
can I confirm that you would also like to donate 5% of yours?	3
If more people gave, even it's a small amount, it truly adds up and can make a difference.	3
I would love to help them a little bit (as per my ability), it will also helpful for those children to have a better life than the others.	3
I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	3
You take care and have a good day.	3
In which countries do they serve?	0
how do you help them.	4
Yes.	3
Yes I have but don't know a whole lot about them since there are so many children related charities.	3
Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.	3
What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	3
I would be happy to listen.	3
I don't currently, I have donated to an animal shelter a few months ago however.	3
I see no reason not to help this charity.	3
No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	3
Thats awesome!	3
That's funny that you mention that.	3
Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	3
How much are you donating?	4
We really are.	3
Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt.	3
This will be ten for each of us.	3
Oh i bet. I would love to hear stories about the children that have been saved	3
How does this work?	3
Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?	0
I'll look into the website and likely donate $5.	1
Thank you for your time and information!	3
i have not, can you tell me more?	0
yes! i said that's a fair point.	3
ok.	3
They do lots of TV adverts.	3
I donate to many local charities in my city.	3
Yea what do you got?	3
I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	3
In the scheme of things, a life is a life, but I am American and feel it important to help my fellow Americans	4
I haven't, is that a charity?	6
I feel like it's a shame and I wish we could do more.	3
I will donate $0.25	3
I enjoyed this.	3
I was glad to hear that.	3
Oh ok.	3
I hope it is helpful to the children	3
We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	3
Hiya	3
I would do the same	3
i would like to donate .05 cents	3
What kinds of things do children's charities do?	0
I agree.	3
Can you please explain more about it?	0
How about .20?	3
OK sounds good.	3
global?	0
That is convenient!!!	3
OK thanks.	3
They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	3
I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.	3
ok, I'll do $1 but I want to know your mturk worker ID to prove it's a person	3
where are you	3
I would be interested in making a donation	3
wow that is neat	3
I don't think I'm quite ready to decide yet though.	2
i like to help since people have helped me	3
true, we live a life and it would be more fun to live beautifully and happily but not only for ourselves but to be happy for all the people who surround us somewhat	3
I'm doing well.	3
That's nice.	3
what will you do with this money.	0
thank you!	3
Have you ever donated to them?	3
There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	6
in what way?	3
Have you ever thought about the benefits from the donations?	0
I will donate 50 cents	3
That's awful.	3
do you donate often?	3
If you could donate some money today, how much would you donate?	4
I think so.	3
I am one who like to donate.	3
Yeah I've seen a lot of the news on Syria, it's horrible.	3
That's true.	3
Like a newsletter?	3
Thanks for making me aware of this charity!	3
Just to confirm, I'm donating 80% of my task amount.	3
Great.	3
That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.	5
every other month or so, but not to them	3
That's nice.	3
I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	3
Is there a reason children in particular are so special to you?	3
I'll donate .50.	3
Hello how are	3
(1, o.k. let's say 1600 dollares total, o.k.?	3
That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	3
Perfect thank you for the information.Is there a website where I can check it out and donate?	0
When iIsaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iIshould not have ised that term, nor did I mean it lightly, I meant physically donating time and skills.	3
I have heard about it.	3
I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.	3
Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.	8
It is very refreshing to see.	3
Well how do i make a donation to them?	0
you also done a great job	3
I will not donate anything $0.	9
If sometimes I go down the street and there are people with posters I raise money for children and I always give them something because it is a good cause	8
Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.	5
I love children.	3
Is it about the civil war in Syria?	0
If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	0
Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something.	3
I want to thank you again for bringing awareness to this important charity.	3
Lets do $1.00 for now but I am glad you have made me aware of an organization that I can look into in order to help others.	3
It sounds familiar.	3
and what country or countries are these children located in	0
Where did you get that information and who specifically is the money going to?	0
That is a good way to think about it.	3
The donations to heal and help with health issues is very crucial	3
Glad to see it goes to shelter, clothing, and food.	3
usually thats how you persuade ppl to donate.	0
sound good.	3
That is something I could really get behind.	3
I wish this wasn't true.	3
Do you donate money only?	4
I have heard about it but I do not know wgat they do	3
I already checked it out and it seems pretty good.	3
I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.	6
I don't know much about their events.	3
I want to help out as much as I can.	3
Thank you, I would like to make a 50 dollar donation but first.	0
If everyone would just give something, everyone could have food and a warm place to sleep.	4
And why do so many of these countries continually need help?	4
I did not know that.	3
O I have heard of Save the children.	3
Hello	3
Ok, I would like to.	3
Well it is a bit rainy, and it has been cold, but we are going to get a heat wave in the high 80's this week!	3
how do i make the donation?	0
I have just done some quick research and am inclined to donate when I have the opportunity.	3
Do they have any focus right now?	0
ok, good deal, $0.50 it is.	3
yes thats ok	3
I think we have to complete 10 turns, so here's to another one!	3
62% is amazing.	3
If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.	3
i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	3
from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	4
Thank you, have a great day!	3
Okay, thank you.	3
Can you tell me more about it?	0
Have a great day.	3
How do you feel about that?	3
thats good children deserve it	3
I have!	3
I feel the happiest man in the world when I donate some help if she is, I feel very good when my help is happening to people	3
I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	3
why do you don't want to donate?	4
have a great day too	3
I'm good.	3
I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?	3
I think Red Cross does a broad array of services	3
I will donate half of my earnings.	3
Things like that?	0
I would perhaps be interested can you tell me more a bout it	0
Thank you and I do not want to be rude but I am straight talking person	3
hi, how are you?	3
Happy to be able to help such a worthy cause!	3
Ok I will be willing to donate $100.	3
I could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?	0
It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	3
Half of whatever I am going to get paid for this task	3
I'm a little familiar with the charity though.	3
i'm glad to help	3
$0.10-Can you see this?	3
Can you tell me more about what they do?	0
Unfortunately I don't have much money right now to help.	7
ok.it only pays $0.30 though	3
I have not heard of Save the Children?	3
Hello	3
I make money as a musician so basically I don't make money.	7
how long was the charity been run	0
I work with children who have terminal illnesses.	3
Hmm, I can do maybe 100.	3
I would lock into half.	3
I am an informed donor and want to make sure my money is really helping these children	0
I do not, can you tell me some?	0
Good, What do you think is the greatest social issue we are facing right now?	3
I will look at the website after this survey and read more about it..I promise	1
Works better on skeptics.	3
Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	3
Whatever my task payment will be.	3
Do you work for them or have you donated with them before?	3
WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	3
Maybe I will have to do some research first.	1
Ok, that's great.	3
Does it help children in this country or in another country?	0
That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	3
I'd rather contribute my donation locally.	8
Like.	3
how much should i give?	3
Col.	3
I've done that before on other tasks.	3
That sounds right from what I know.	3
that is not bad	3
I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	3
I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	3
same to you and good night	3
Sounds like a good mission, but I probably won't be able to donate	9
yeah i know how donation works.	3
I recognize it too.	3
Sure, I will donate 50 cents to them.	3
Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	3
where is this organization based?	0
I think it's time to take a walk a little later!	3
I hate to be so prejudicial, but I care about the kids around me more than ones I cannot see!	3
There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	6
hello how are you	3
Sure.	3
wow that is a huge number isnt it	5
That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!	3
How often are you able to do that?	3
