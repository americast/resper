i will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.	9
good morning!	9
amazing!	9
for sure.	9
perfect thank you for the information.is there a website where i can check it out and donate?	5
okay done.. thanks	9
i also ive to bakc to school drives and food pantries	2
my few cents would never go toward a children's charity.	1
i will be honest, what i had heard though wasnt positive.	4
how much is the average donation	9
half would work for me.	9
hello, how are you today?	9
since you are so into helping out kids	7
i'm good how about you?	9
how about .20?	9
i'll certainly review it.	8
no i havent.	9
yea...i was donate the charity of save the children.....	9
what a great idea!	9
okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?	7
i'm sure that when i have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	8
thats great, thank you	9
yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need !	9
i think they are a trustworthy organization.	9
i have been research the make-a-wish foundation.	9
overall, i feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	9
can i direct my money?	9
parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	9
please be specific about how it will help these children that save the children claims to be saving?	5
these days there are tons of people asking for donations for fake charities, it's sad.	9
ok.	9
you sure?	9
children should be our top priority all across the world.	9
you have idea donate to that charity	9
i agree!	9
i would be	9
right.	9
in one occasion trip to latin america and there the situation is very sad, many children live in the street without anyone	9
have a nice day!	9
so, save the children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	9
yes, i do	9
i think i might donate mine too!	6
i would like more information to be sent to me so i could look into it	6
ok, that's great.	9
i am willing to match your donation.	9
i would be willing to donate to this organization.	9
hiya	9
no i am not, but like i said.	9
yes it is.	9
good morning.	9
ok.	9
you take care and have a good day.	9
children hold the future of the world.	9
i feel good about this.	9
i am sorry i am unable to help.	3
great!	9
and how is the charity promoted?	5
yes i will donate	9
generous?	9
i know it's not much, but wanted to do something.	9
i think about them so often.	9
okay, i will think about it.	9
yes i do,do you as well?	9
what about helping children who are living in poverty in america.	7
of course im hear to listen .	9
i usually donate like i would in real life...	9
how can someone help?	9
i hope you continue your donations.	9
i think you are a wonderful person.	9
much better.	9
hey, before i forget, i did not tell you about the weather here.	9
yes.	9
do you know what percentage of donations goes directly to programs (as opposed to overhead costs, salaries, and expenses)?	5
i made $100+ everyday last week on mturk and now all i have left is these low paying surveys	9
okay that is nice and simple.	9
yes, i have.	9
is there a specific age or race of children that save the children are looking to benefit?	5
i don't know much about that charity all all.	9
i'm sorry.	9
well i'm sure there is always more that can be done.	9
will the penny be taken from my mturk account?	9
yes everything counts, that's how it starts.	9
do you know of a good one?	9
save the children sounds like an amazing organization.	9
i am sure there are many ways to help	9
i've heard of them.	9
i think it's a scam	4
i'm glad a charity like that exists internationally.	9
people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	9
oh wow, i would also be interested in donating to that.	9
terrible thing that happens	9
health and education both are important factors	9
i think we each have to exchange 10 messages before i can do that	9
i do not have any children yet.	9
i've heard of them but other then that no not much how about you?	5
it's cloudy a lot, but otherwise fine.	9
5 dollars buys a latte, and i think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	9
i completely agree with you.	9
maybe i will have to do some research first.	8
i need the money as well	3
great.	9
the photo would be nice, it would let me know and connect with someone i am helping.	9
i will like to know about the opportunity first	5
i will give .20	9
agreed, which is probably what they want.	9
what children's charity would you like to donate money to?	9
how much are you donating?	7
i also want to make sure my donations are not going into the pockets of money hungry ceo's.	4
as in my weekly paycheck?	9
that's awesome, what other countries does it support besides syria?	5
i forgot to ask, how is the weather by you today?	9
they are a great organization.	9
i will happily donate 60 cents.	9
i hope that is adequate and helps them for food and shelter.	9
nice!	9
but its ok, i work every sunday.	9
i don't know which one and presumably talk about a donation to said charity.	9
would 60% of the task payment be enough?	9
i don't believe i have.	9
i have a small budget but know any amount matters.	9
very good.	9
well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	9
oh, thanks for the website, i am sure that it has a lot of information that i could use to learn more about it.	9
i have not visited the site but i have heard of them before.	9
no there is not	9
any amount i believe is good.	9
whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	9
do you have information about their charity rating?	5
that sounds wonderful!	9
glad to help.	9
do they help children from a particular country or is it all around the world?	5
but we can always try.	9
i am actually not sure.	9
it does.	9
we can help them out their physical needs like good cloths, probably orphanage (home to stay)	9
i have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.	9
yes, i do.	9
i will.	9
very good today, just turking	9
i may give a few cents	9
i always try to donate anonymously.	9
perhaps i could help out a little.	9
i know!	9
yes 0.15 is correcr	9
no ill donate to local charities	2
if i donate to this charity your talking about i need to know the name and information to agree to a donation	9
i am glad i can help in anyway that i can.	9
definitely i like to help in anyway that i can to help children and animals.	9
ok i will be willing to donate $100.	9
sometimes , it depends on what types	9
if i had the money that some people have, i would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	3
i'll still do $20 and go through the site.	8
certainly as long as i know the donation will help the children	9
either way its cool.	9
ok got it.	9
i guess so.	9
i will not donate anything $0.	1
wow that is wonderful.	9
children and animals are the most precious of god's creations.	9
what do i do now?	9
this goes into a different fund.	1
ok cool is there a website?	5
it is really sad that save a child exists, the world should be a safe place for children and there should be no need.	9
i would like to donate 20 cents	9
you have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	9
how transparent are they about uses of their funds?	5
the more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	9
i will donate more than $100	9
through internet ads?	5
i've been following the news about family separations very closely.	9
what are they?	9
i have thought about it in the past.	9
how much is the typical donation amount usually?	9
you too.	9
do you already donate to them?	9
do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	5
sure i will donate 30%.	9
oh wow, so i could just go ahead and do like $25 million?	5
that sounds fantastic!	9
yes.	9
yes, i would like to donate at least one dollar to help save the children.	9
i agree all the way that they are the best creations of all.	9
i will take the option of donating into consideration.	8
how much many are we talking and how you want me to pay	9
so you think monetary donations are the best course of action?	9
the charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	9
i will donate half of my earnings.	9
feeling great.	9
what was the monetary donation you were seeking?	9
go right ahead.	9
wow!that's really great!	9
have you?	9
yes you can count on my donation	9
me 2.	9
i have seen a lot of people do the same.	9
does save the children help find a place for refugees?	5
what other organizations would you consider?	7
how does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	5
no thank you for the work that you do	9
i am mostly aware yes.	9
do you know how much of the donation goes to the children?	5
i live in new york	9
i think i'll probably donate at the end of this conversation.	9
i would be willing to donate $200	9
i thinkit's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.	9
do they have a donation tier level?	5
what types of children's rights?	5
i'm doing very well thank you!	9
there are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.	4
awesome, i'll head over there right now and support it thank you.	9
yeah i know how donation works.	9
their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.	9
i feel bad about only giving $5, do you think we should give more?	5
that is amazing!	9
i have seen a lot of commercials on tv for it.	9
they also don't disclose their funds	4
thanks!	9
our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	9
that is all i can afford	9
i have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.	9
i'm doing well!	9
i have!	9
you do make a point.	9
oh!	9
well, i know i said $5, but i think i will make it $10.	9
and they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	9
i already help an organization but would be glad to help another one too.	2
nope 1 is cool	9
i wish they can help even more countries	9
they do a lot for kids	9
i haven't donated to them, which is good apparently.	9
it was nice talking, thanks for all you do.	9
yes i would.	9
with some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	9
i wish i could give more, but i am broke	3
i think it was from save the children.	9
ok ill give that	9
actually, their own website may be a biased barometer of their giving.	4
yes, i believe it is good to be ethical.	9
would that help?	9
unfortunately, i have to take care of my kids, too, and can't afford to help more.	3
what are your donations used for?	5
i donate sometimes.	9
i sometimes question charities that i don't really know	2
i am more interested in this.	9
thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	9
do they help children in africa	5
what exactly happened to these children's?	5
so i donate that charity	9
and what do you do at the organization?	5
how much goes to administrative costs?	5
it takes a lot to fix this country already so your effort is definitely astounding.	9
that really isn't an answer to the previous question, though	0
sure, i will donate 50 cents to them.	9
no i have not...what is it about?	9
what do you do as a volunteer for this charity?	5
what about your job	9
im not sure that i am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but i do see your point.	3
how can you assure me?	9
thank you for your time.	9
it sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	5
how are you?	9
sometimes i question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	9
i have been scammed before.	3
i think they might even help in hawaii with the recent floods, don't you think?	9
you can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	9
that's nice of you.	9
good point, i think i may consider it	6
yes .	9
as i recall, for save the children, they were given a bad reputation back in the '90s due to their excessive spending on administration costs vs. program expenditures.	4
thank you for your recognition.	9
sure, i will match your $0.50.	9
i do donate sometimes, yes.	9
thanks.	9
well that seems better than some i have read about.	9
what does 5 dollars get these children?	5
i would certainly be willing to donate then	9
i think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	9
yes i have- i feel its violence too	9
yes i have two a boy and a girl.	9
what sort of assistance do they offer specifically?	5
what kind of situations do they work with?	5
that sounds really cool.	9
sure, i will donate 10 cents	9
do they need clothes as well?	5
i'm not a nurse though, and couldn't possibly travel to africa or anywhere else.	9
that would be so sweet of them.	9
good charity.	9
no i am not.	9
thanks again for chatting with me.	9
how long have you been donating?	9
if a charity is doing good work to feed the hungry, i will give what i have to spare.	9
o.k. task done	9
i took a look at the website.	9
absolutely.	9
do you have an amount in mind?	9
hey, i am doing well	9
not really.	9
yes, i might have to wait until my check arrives.	8
thank u sir	9
how do people donate to the charity?	9
i can imagine, that is horrible.....	9
what is it about?	5
i am somewhat of a tight budget, but i always make room for good causes.	9
very good, do you think they may just get the money and dont help no one?	4
is that even worth it?	9
which is why i trust them.	2
i will copy and save the website address.	9
how do i know my money goes to the cause and not just to the pockets of the people that run it.	4
yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to st jude	2
it's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.	9
that is very awesome.	9
would you mind telling me about it?	9
i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	9
yes! i said that's a fair point.	9
could you quickly tell me about it	5
education is must for everyone in the world.	9
plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	9
i appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.	9
sure i will donate 20 cents.	9
you as well.	9
similiar, i only donate when i have the money to spare.	9
that sounds good with me, however now i am thinking perhaps i should donate more, what do you think?	9
i have never been to the site.	9
that's nice.	9
i've never heard of that one.	9
in what way?	9
but i would like to give more than a measly $2.	9
same to you!	9
my charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	9
$5.00 i would donate	9
i would be glad to make a $10 donation	9
that is correct.	9
how long have you been doing that?	9
no.	9
i'm so gonna support it!	9
no can you tell me a little about it	5
i just read about a charity called the project linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	9
okay, thank you.	9
i'm good.	9
i think so, it said we need to get to 10 turns of the conversation each, this is my 8th lol	9
how did save the children help?	9
where did you get that information and who specifically is the money going to?	5
i would be interested in making a donation	9
i think our must move cautiously to deal with this country.	9
do they help children right here in america	5
thanks, that is awesome	9
i'm not sure if i want to, but i can give a little.	6
how would this donation be made?	9
i would be willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cent payment to help save children.	9
okay..and how are you	9
i know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	9
i am not willing to donate from my study payment as this money is vital to me.	3
therefore we should do our best to make that happen	9
i see - how many years have you been with them	9
words are just words sometimes.	4
you are welcome; anything for the children i say!	9
of course i could do so from my paypal	9
i need to know these things before i donate even if it is as little as $2.	4
who runs the organization now?	5
yeah i try to do that too.	9
yeah, i have used gospel for asia in the past	2
i have not.	9
what kind of payments do you take?	9
do they?	9
yeah, i mean, i guess	9
i would give it all if i weren't	9
that is terrible.	9
i'd love to visit one of their facilities.	9
probably more.	9
so do i provide my email to you?	9
i would love to help.	9
it's good to be able to help someone else out and have it be easy and painless.	9
you too my friend	9
what do you have in mind?	7
you're right!	9
yes, i absolutely would.	9
i'd be willing to donate $.05.	9
i know a little bit.	9
i have not heard of this charity before!	9
no, i do not waste any money, right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	1
have you ever heard of evangelism?	0
there are many charities for children than just that one.	2
how about .50 cents	9
oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	9
i appreciate you trying to get me to though.	9
it looks really good and professional.	9
helping people makes people feel good	9
that is so nice of you.	9
usually i donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	2
i'd be willing to donate a dollar or two	9
interesting.	9
this hit is a rip off, taking far too much time.	9
every other month or so, but not to them	9
children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.	9
thats awesome!	9
that's always good, it's not good to donate somewhere that they don't give to what they're supposed to be donating to	4
i agree.	9
i'd like to try and donate at regular intervals, like every month.	9
i donate to many local charities in my city.	9
yes that is	9
we must help the children to give education.	9
what do they do?	5
i think we have to complete 10 turns, so here's to another one!	9
what hobbies do you like?	9
great! thanks so much and i'm just so happy to be able to donate	9
i would donate some clothes and some toys for children	9
thank you	9
i can give $0.60 cents.	9
you?	9
oh thats very easy then	9
i've seen companies go to 70% and i can't help but judge them for it.	9
that's a whole lot of rice and flour.	9
i'm afraid i don't know anything about save the children.	9
i'd donate 50 cents of my payment.	9
what do they do to help children?	5
how are you doing?	9
what are your thoughts?	9
how do i know if it's a legit organization	4
i like to learn as much as i can about an organization before donating.	9
i guess i could throw them .10	9
ok, i will consider doing that.	6
oh wow ok how much do you suggest?	9
make a wish is really cool.	9
for example, myself being from albuquerque new mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. and what about you?	9
how much do you think that i should give?	9
i hate to be so prejudicial, but i care about the kids around me more than ones i cannot see!	9
thank you again for donating $10 to save the children.	9
no.	9
it really upsets me	9
awesome.	9
what areas of the world do they cover?	5
i have to get going.	9
i have heard of save the children but i'd rather keep my donations us-based	2
but that's pretty cool what they do.	9
how would i go about donating today	9
super.	9
did you have any worries about food, shelter, safety, etc.?	9
i have helped at soup kitchens before but that's my own extent	9
what types of programs does it offer?	5
i would like to donate money to a charity to help this cause	9
hello!	9
yes i do	9
interesting.	9
where is the charity based out of?	5
nice talking you.	9
i am glad to help.	9
i love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	9
i have a cousin who works with mercyship.	9
do you currently volunteer with this charity?	9
awesome!	9
not only are they ravaged by the volcano, now a hurricane.	9
so sad.	9
is there another way to donate?/	9
you are very welcome.	9
okay, if you don	9
another charity i read about is reach out and read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	9
i'm not going to donate.	1
also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	2
if we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	9
thanks very much, nice speaking to you.	9
what do you need me to do?	9
so you think they do some actual good?	9
i can't afford much.	3
that's great!	9
we still have chat a bit more.	9
i could even go for the whole $.30 if you want.	9
darn really gonna make me miss out on that bad of chips huh?...lol how about $1.15 and you have yourself a deal...	3
how would i know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity	4
alright then i'll donate half of whatever i can.	9
i couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids.	9
thank you!	9
yes like 5 dollars	9
i will absolutely look to donating something later, just because i have always wanted to anyways and now this so why not.	9
yes, sometimes with non profits	9
i have an idea.	9
is there an upper limit?	9
thank you too.	9
no problem.	9
yes i understand.	9
it makes me feel that even though not enough i have done a little something.	9
they want to make sure it doesn't happen to the ones that come after us.	9
yes they will	9
i agree.	9
do they help people here in the usa?	5
the payment of the task is 30 cents, i would donate 10c	9
its all good bud.	9
have you ever sponsored a child?	7
vancouver.	9
however, i am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	7
no i will not until i do further research.	1
or a whole lot of bandages.	9
what does save the children do?	5
how are you?	9
finnnnnne take the $1.25.	9
i'm surprised i've never heard about it! how do i know if it's legit and if money really go to help those kids	4
does it come from our reward/bonuses?	9
or do you donate to other ones also?	7
i would not be willing to donate, because i have never seen any impact made by their organization.	2
that's really good to hear!	9
do you donate to them?	7
i like the sound of that!	9
my life is going good.	9
i have a passion for helping children also.	9
yes, i do.	9
like most people who do mturk, i do really need the money to pay my bills.	3
i am not sure i am just very biased	4
thank you so much!	9
i wish i could give more.	9
okay, i might donate	9
they are our future exactly.	9
that is a noble cause.	9
its paying me .30	9
i'm sorry	9
if i make donations now, they are in-kind donations rather than monetary donations.	2
what do you think?	9
where do i sign up?	9
no i have not but i am interested!	9
yes i do	9
yes i have.	9
it is the least i can do for him.	9
i assume save the children would be able helping children in three world countries.	9
yes i do think that they do.	9
hi!	9
i bet the kids there are in need.	9
could i pledge $1/day to start with?	9
what do they support exactly?	5
no, i hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	9
just got back from the gym	9
if that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	9
is there a monetary goal set for the year?	5
i think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	9
thank you,i just want to help this world and especially the children within it and save the children is doing that job	9
awesome.	9
i would if i could.	9
if only all kids were so lucky.	9
i think i will donate to them today too.	9
you are very welcome!	9
i'd rather send the money on my accord, rather than have it deducted.	9
i will be sure to donate.	9
i do know save the children.	9
they have a lot of information there.	9
so what is this about anyway?	9
i have as well.	9
that's good.	9
do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	4
i will donate within 3 months	8
yes i sure will do donate.	9
yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause	9
i make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that i do.	2
hi	9
i am hoping that things will change soon.	9
so if i donate will 100% of my donation go to a child?	4
you do have to be skeptical though	9
is this charity local?	5
i could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?	5
would you whole heartedly donate?	4
oh!	9
i'm glad they do that but there are many charities that claim to do the same thing.	7
ugh that is rough..nobody deserves that in this world	9
ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	5
i usually just try to go with half for these things.	9
ok, sounds good.	9
that sounds like a great idea!	9
that's good.	9
i can spare a quarter if it helps.	9
and thanks for helping!	9
yeah, i have one, but i don't use the camera.	9
and you?	9
ok, well thank you for your time and telling me about this wonderful organization.	9
are we supposed to mutually agree to both give a certain amount?	9
i have an old nikon 360 camera that takes film.	9
that is an incredible figure!!!	9
yes, and it all adds up at the end of the month especially when you're also struggling to make ends meet.	9
i do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.	1
very cool, i have heard of them but never looked into them too closely.	9
children are one of the worlds most important assets.	9
i can donate a dollar for now since i don't have much right but i feel obligated to at least donate something.	9
it was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.	4
anything that helps children succeed is definitely a great cause	9
what type of people or who manages this fund?	5
you too!	9
really?	9
what is the donation for?	9
i hope i can still participate in the chats without donating.	9
it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.	9
i'm glad you're enjoying it.	9
i don't have much. how about .25?	9
i'll be honest with you, i have made donations to children's charities in the past.	2
heart breaking.	9
yes, it is a worthy organization and i do believe that it helps in many substantial ways.	9
i have heard about it.	9
childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	9
how much can i donate?	9
ok that sounds easy enough.	9
sure, i'd be glad to donate $0.25 to save the children.	9
that's nice.	9
you are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	9
how do you have experience with them?	9
why are you passionate about this particular one?	9
i am not sure i know what save the children is.	9
thanks so much!	9
do you know where save the children mainly operates out of?	5
it's not much, but i don't have much money.	3
it was a pleasure talking to you as well!	9
doing good.	9
of course, especially poor children	9
it's heartbreaking!	9
oh ok then $50	9
well that is really great.	9
i have not heard of save the children?	9
they seem to be.	9
how do they help children?	5
hows $0.50 sound?	9
thank you!	9
i can't imagine not being able to see my son!	9
i feel much better donating to places where i feel confident that the moneyis going to where they say it will.	9
that way i know where my money is going.	9
i haven't!	9
yes, in fact ill most likely give ten thousand	0
i will donate all of my payment.	9
i have heard that they work hard to give kids a better life.	9
especially animal organizations.	7
hmm, i can do maybe 100.	9
where does the other 10 cents go then?...and i guess it's a good thing i decided to give them that dollar then =)	4
that is not bad	9
how they managing in 120 countries?	5
do you work for them directly how did you get involved in this?	7
what part of the world will it go to?	5
we have a school here in my small town for children from broken homes.	2
i need a little more information, if thats not too much to ask?	5
yes, a few times before	9
i see, so i am thinking of donating half.	9
i am doing good and you?	9
i see they are top rated charity	9
ok, sounds good.	9
is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	5
how long has the organization been established and what is the success rate of the program?	5
sure.	9
nice!	9
what will you do with this money.	5
sure i would love to	9
i do think it is a good cause.	9
so how did you decide what was right for you?	9
where, on their website?	9
it was nice speaking with you! :)	9
yes, thank you.	9
i\'m not going to donate to some generic "save the children" charity with no information.	1
it's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	9
what is the minimum dollar amount?	9
so lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus.	9
it does.	9
of course i have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	9
could you please tell me more about this charity?	5
it's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.	9
that sounds good, deal	9
that's amazing.	9
i think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	9
what is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	9
yes i am	9
i can't donate less than 0.50?	0
let's make a donation.	9
how are you?	9
ok thank you sounds good,	9
i have to go to work at 11:30-6.	9
i have not heard of that charity.	9
i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	9
powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	7
that is awesome then i will donate $1.	9
i will do that.	9
if there isn't coverage then people tend put it out of their minds.	9
what kind of children's charities do you think are the most important?	5
that would be something i would do, yes.	9
yes, i'm interested.	9
if everyone would just give something, everyone could have food and a warm place to sleep.	7
i really need the money that i'm earning for this task, so i feel like giving 10 cents to this charity is fair.	9
great!	9
sounds like a good charity.	9
you too!!!!! :d	9
no, i haven't.	9
very welcome.	9
in which regions are the donations applied?	5
sure!	9
oh i would donate money too even it 5 dollars	9
glad to help	9
i hope it is not too severe.	9
yes- the war in syria had traumatized many children	9
oh, that is nice!	9
i will donate 50 cents	9
i really do want to participate but i can't make any donations today.	1
how much of donations go to the kids?	5
i make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	2
i am i am thinking of people here i dont care about the rest	2
do they have a car?	9
i knew it was a large number, which is one of the things i was thinking save the children could help with	5
i would like to donate	9
yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children	9
i like to help since people have helped me	9
okay, that sounds reasonable	9
you are welcome.	9
however there are lots of kids in my ocuntry that need help first	7
it was lovely chatting with you.	9
and you likewise to ask.	9
my life is awesome and your?	9
i am well, how are you?	9
out of the earnings i earn from this survey i would probably donate at least half.	9
the life of a child is always worth saving.	9
what would benefit me towards donating my $2 to the save the children fund?	9
i plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	9
thanks.	9
i little bit of know save the children life.	9
i guess that is true.	9
hi how are you	9
i was not aware there were many children in need of help in the us	9
what about you?	9
$35,000,000,000.00	9
i'd be fine with donating $1.00 though and i'd keep the other.	9
i was wondering why you were talking about "save the hold ten" vs. "save the children."	0
i can't decide which onne.	9
great idea!!	9
unfortunately i am having some money troubles right now so it's a little hard for me to promise any significant amount of money at the moment.	3
thanks for the info i will check it out	9
if i donated to every cause i would be giving away a lot of money and i already lose 20% to taxes.	3
good	9
it sounds like a good idea, but i often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when i donate i do it to causes that i know about.	2
that is so sad	9
i am well.	9
i dealt with that more when i was working.	9
are you certain that the money will be used the right way?	4
good choice	9
i would if i had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support.	5
what do you think?	7
i'm kinda broke at the moment, though.	3
i will donate 20 cents	9
ok $25 sounds ok	9
thanks so much.	9
sorry im getting off topic.	9
have you ever done any donation to this charity?	7
i know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive.	9
i'm not sure if i'm donating to you or if you're donating to me.	9
that's very impressive, i am glad that i am donating this charity now that i know more about them.	9
when you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	9
this company looks more like a firm than a charity	4
i might donate	6
it makes me feel like life is so unfair, and those of us who can help, should.	9
oh, i didnt know we could do another one?	9
i see no reason not to help this charity.	9
where can i read more about this organization and possible give a donate?	5
you are pretty awesome yourself!	9
yes i do, because it is need.	9
i'm ready to donate, tell me how!	9
do you have any personal connection with that charity?	9
that is good.	9
that is what i like to hear!	9
you shouldtype the samething and if perhaps if you know anything about the charity, share it?	9
what happened?	9
haha that's true!	9
hi.	9
they sound like a good charity to donate to	9
how would i go about this?	9
yeah hopefully	9
that is all your opinion.	0
that is very interesting.	9
i am not familiar with save the children	9
ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month	7
i don't really have a team, but i like baseball.	9
well, is this a lobal charity that will be using my money to spread across their whole organization or will it help buy these children new schools which is a cause that i am really passionate about?	5
oh wow, shocking news.	9
yes i would be interested in doing so	9
you've been great.	9
i don't really remember much about it but i know the basics	9
sure, i'm happy to donate half the payment for the hit	9
personally, transparency is especially vital.	9
that is so heartbreaking.	9
what exactly does the money do for them?	5
that is amazing.	9
sure.	9
yes pleas do	9
very well, how about you?	9
i would.	9
okay.	9
that is a great cause.	9
right, it will probably have to be 80% of my task payment then.	9
i will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	4
hello there!	9
but this group sounds great!	9
okay, i will make a donation for $10.	9
i am how are you doing?	9
have a good evening	9
maybe i'll consider donating to them	6
is there any concrete proof that they do?	4
have you heard any break thought about this charity?	5
what do we need to work out and what would this donation be for?	9
oh that's great and makes me feel better!	9
that sounds like an amazing charity.	9
oh at least a thousand	0
can't complain, youreslf?	9
that would be alright.	9
i would like to learn more about this organization.	5
i am an informed donor and want to make sure my money is really helping these children	5
maybe	9
yes, definitely.	9
i will look at it in the future.	8
i work with children more in an "urban" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.	2
thank you.	9
what kind of stuff do they do to help the children?	5
can you help me with that.	9
i will.	9
lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	9
lol.i'm not a bot......	9
is it reputable?	4
is $20 okay?	9
i've heard of it.	9
how can i help?	9
i have not.	9
i will donate $0.25	9
i'm not sure how much i'd be willing to donate.	8
i would like to donate about 0.50 to the charity	9
i think we should donate at least 17 dollars but less than 19 dollars	9
that's a big plus for me.	9
im pretty sure that if you want someone to donate to a cause you treat them nicely	9
good thanks!	9
yeah, i think an american charity should focus on america too	2
yes, some of these universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	9
i reviewed the site quickly.	9
if you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	9
i suppose that is true.	9
oh, ok.	9
what roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	5
im happy to help	9
yes of course	9
85 cents to 1.35 around here	9
i just can't see doing that.	1
i can donate the .30 base payment but i am still very curious on donating outside the hit.	9
happy to help.	9
but i"m always willing to help!	9
what are the amounts for monthly subscriptions?	5
that's very interesting, sounds like they do good work.	9
sure, do you like donations?	7
you're missing the entire point of what i said if you think downloading that report means something.	4
yes..i am very familiar..	9
does save the children has the offices there?	9
i have not heard of save the children before.	9
hi, how are you?	9
sure.i would be glad to. how much money do you think i should give?	5
where can i go to send it?	5
will i be getting any sort of reward as well?	5
on my side i don't have information about the task, only that we are trying to come up with a donation agreement.	9
not only in the usa, but around the world.	9
i would be interested in doing do, however i must tell you i am generally very skeptical about charity orginizations in general.	4
i love that so much of it goes towards the children	9
personally, i always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity i feel connected to.	9
yes, i agree.	9
it's not easy for me to give anything and no charity has ever helped me.	3
i think i will donate $1, it only seems fair.	9
no, i didn't see anything.	9
have you ever donated?	7
i will try to donate at least five dollars.	9
what forms of payments are accepted?/	5
ah..	9
do you do any volunteer work?	9
that way nobody can question anything.	9
oh ok thats nice	9
what types of programs do they offer?	5
you also have a good day	9
yes definitly develop for education	9
im a perfect world where i had all the resources and money i could stand, i would love to be a philanthropist.	9
do you know if the donations that we are making are tax deductible?	9
how are you?	9
do you know anyone that has worked for them?	5
thats sad so many children were killes	9
the poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.	9
are you a cubs fan?	9
i can donate .10 of my mturk earnings.	9
it is nice to know that!	9
what is their goal?	5
how do i donate?	5
no problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	9
especially if they are children.	9
i usually do donate to charities	2
i am.	9
how is your day going so far?	9
have you ever donated to them?	9
we are pretty lucky to have been born in the united states.	9
okay.	9
how are you?	9
there is quite a bit of training and background checks, but it's worth it!	9
i took a little time to look up information on the organization, but didn't see that.	9
this will be ten for each of us.	9
yes, i hear they feed starving children all over the world.	9
i would really like to help.	9
most people wouldn't give anything and it makes me really happy to meet someone that would help with whatever they can.	9
wonderful!	9
a little, what do they do?	5
actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly	1
how do you raise donations?	9
do they provide medical help too though?	5
hi	9
it sounds like a meaningful charity.	9
i am excited to know we can help out a children's charity.	9
he was in the end i think, this is the kind of things i have about our civilization , many dnt have to eat and many waste their food, its not right	9
are you based in america? are you an american?	9
i would donate	9
what would donating like that help inform me on the charity?	9
i think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people	2
yes that is true.	9
very good and you	9
not my time anymore no...too busy	9
i'm proud too.nice working with you.	9
boy and girl.	9
yes i am very interested!	9
i'm often skeptical of big charities like that.	4
do you accept monthly donations of smaller amounts?	5
what do i need to know about them?	9
how much do you donate?	7
i think this is all very interesting stuff.	9
what?	9
i should do more to help.	9
i think i would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	9
mostly working on surveys	9
it was great chatting with you.	9
it is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.	9
sure, i'll donate $0.05.....	9
oh i bet. i would love to hear stories about the children that have been saved	9
anything else i should know	5
of course i am very interested to donate funds to charity	9
my money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	0
in my church we help people no matter their age, but children are special for us	9
charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	9
i think i have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.	9
thank you.	9
where does it mainly operate?	5
helping children and pets is one of the donations i enjoy making and helping at the same time.	9
iwork in an office setting as well, i guess we are to talk about childrens charity's.	9
how much of the donations goto the children and the effort?	5
wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	9
i am born and raised in florida	9
good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	9
hurricane season is upon us, so i'm keeping a really close eye on that.	9
what did you get him?	5
wow.	9
ok, i'll do $1 but i want to know your mturk worker id to prove it's a person	9
lets leave it at that.	9
doing good you?	9
do you have anything like that?	9
no i have not	9
i do sometimes whe i have extra money	2
ok are we to decide annamount?	9
although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what i have seen.	9
that really is terrible to think about.	9
sounds like a good charity.	9
yes i also like to donate to the children without parents and relatives.	9
i feel like they'll just take my donation and get their tax credit.	4
i can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	9
i feel very bad for the children in syria.	9
how much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?	9
is that the organization that is helping single parents obtain support from absent parents?	5
same.	9
i think it would really help them out	9
i was wondering that.	9
okay,so we are in agreement on the paymentto the charity.	9
just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	5
work here is the other thing, my donation comes from my other payment	8
ya fine morning what about you	9
although that one is easier to spin as seeking more money to fund more projects.	0
i like to support organizations that are christian based and help further the spread of the gospel to all of god's children.	9
hai whats up	9
not really.	9
yes, what would this charity be doing to save the children?	5
no i would be interested in learning	9
i am always worried if i donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	4
if i define what makes me happy in life is to look and my beloved happy man	9
i'm lucky to feed myself and my children, but i believe i could probably manage to send $5	3
how much am i allowed to donate?	9
are you talking about around the world or in the states?	5
yes i believe it most definetly will make a big impact on others lives and its amazing to see such kind hearted people like yourself do so.	9
hey, is there a limit?	5
3 dollars	9
i don't have any experiences like that but i'm sure it must have been very difficult and scary to go through that as a child.	9
so it's not that i don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.	2
i could donate 10 cents.	9
do you have any more information about it?	5
that's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	9
i have not heard about it.	9
sure, go ahead	9
are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	9
thank you very much	9
what kind of children's charities do you know about?	5
i accept your view and it is necessary that everyone should contribute at least to some extent to children's charity	9
so, above it says, "we encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	9
really?	9
do they help kids in africa	5
ok, sounds great!	9
it was syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	9
i don't like to donate to for profit businesses.	4
what does the organization provide?	5
you have a good day as well.	9
i have kids here that need help first	7
anything else i should know about this charity?	5
nice!!!	9
i'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	7
i can't work all day.	3
that's awful.	9
i think we have a few turns to go	9
every bit helps.	9
i'd like to donate 5 dollar	9
it's a very noble cause.	9
warlords in the usa get elected to political office unfortunately.	0
i would want to still donate $1 to the save the children charity.	9
yes i am aware of that charity	9
good to know.	9
you have no facts to back that up.	0
i would think it is very valuable	9
depending on their financial standpoint, i think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	9
hi	9
i'm not sure!	9
you sound very passionate about them.	9
what is my payment for this task?	9
i realize that	9
yes, i agree	9
that's fantastic.	9
that is good.	9
it's really nice outside where i am so i am sitting outdoors.	9
that breaks my heart.	9
i do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing i can do for them or anyone else.	3
sure i will check this link.	8
ok how much do you need?	9
hi there!	9
i am okay.	9
i'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but i am grateful they try and that others get involved.	9
is this a legit charity?	4
yes i would	9
i believe it could be true.	9
i can't wait for my check to come so i can help out in other countries!	8
i hope that is the case as i hate to read about children in danger.	9
there are other charities i'd like to donate to over this one.	2
i can donate $0.50.	9
would be happy to donate.	9
good for you!	9
that would defintely interest me.	9
okay.	9
i am fine, thanks!	9
thank you for the information you provided.	9
yes, it sounds like a good charity.	9
no, i haven't heard of save the children.	9
oh, yep.	9
no, there are other charities that do a much better job in my opinion that i already donate to, such as compassion international and world vision for international children's relief, and my local food shelter.	2
hello, yes i have but i am not sure what the charity works towards	5
ok - so can i donate $20?	9
i heard that some bad weather was going to be coming.	9
and share on social media could be the next step?	9
the red cross and greenpeace were my main charity donations this year	2
that is very generous!	9
i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	9
i don't mind helping those abroad.	9
thank you!	9
well, i can't imagine anyone would much less a child....	9
what is the website?	9
i'd love to hear more.	9
5 percent i would donate	9
why you laugh.	9
well, i grew up in a wealthy house.	9
very good to do	9
do i need to do anything else to make sure i get the money donated?	9
which charity are you passionate about?	7
have you ever donated to children?	7
i could certainly ask some of my coworkers and tell them about the match if they donate at least $500 and tell them what a worthy cause it is.	9
you can send me the information with the email you have on file for me. :)	9
which children?	9
that's a really good number considering the overhead that must be required for international relief.	9
if it's a charity i believe in that's a great way.	9
what kind of camera do you have?	9
no thank you	1
thank you.	9
very intresting	9
i do hope i can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	9
like this task would donate the mturk payment to the charity?	9
i am glad to help!	9
what service does this charity provide?	5
i am very interested in the welfare of the children especially in regard to food and education which i consider as very important for children	9
the people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.	9
hey hows it?	5
i wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	9
i really appreciate your willingness to go out on a limb.	9
how can i donate?	9
are you going to donate too?	7
that is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	9
i recently saw a old movie at the theatre called casablanca with humphrey bogart.	9
yes i know i will donate 5 dollars	9
no, i do not wish to donate at this time.	1
am not financially stable now, but i love to help such children soon	3
i think i have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.	9
awesome.	9
i am on a very tight budget.	3
is this okay?	9
how does the sponsorship work?	5
wherever and whoever that may be.	9
how many children do they serve each year and how much of a donation are you talking about?	5
there are no facts that prove that to be true.	4
i would be glad to.	9
i have never sought out a charity and that brings up a good point.	9
this is,url??	5
you sound very passionate about this subject.	9
the instructions weren't super clear on my end.	9
sorry but not now.	1
point taken.	9
i would like to donate	9
no, i have not.	9
no, not really.	9
how much of the donation would actually go to the kids>	5
nothing is just given to us soooo i am not going to give away something that i work for unless i want to do so.	3
i dont know	9
the website says that 86% of funds go to the cause.	9
hi, i'm doing ok, how are you?	9
it is going alright, thanks	9
well that's disappointing.	9
oh yes, i have heard that they do very important work!	9
i am interested in donating most of my task payment.	9
so you have completely trust your money would go where you intend to?	4
yeah i think its good to help any little bit you can.	9
i'm a little familiar with the charity though.	9
how did the visit go?	9
i'm really glad to hear that.	9
so i like that 86% is going to the cause.	9
i think i'd like to donate 0.05	9
yes i can donate.	9
shelter?	5
thank you.	9
i'll donate $0.05	9
thats an awesome labor	9
it gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	9
how much do you usually donate every year>	5
just in my country (united states)?	5
education?	9
do you mean in the usa?	9
how much of a donation are you talking about?	9
oh, really?	9
wow, that's very generous.	9
while im in the grave cause i didnt have enough money to buy that bag of chips....	3
that's pretty impressive.	9
yes, so i think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	9
thank you!	9
i would like to to donate $1.00 as a mturk worker	9
you as well. thank you for the chat :)	9
as far as donating i have no problem donating to a greater cause as long as it benefits others short term and long term.	4
i think i'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so i'm about to move on.	9
i like to be able to help as many as possible	9
do i what with save the children	9
i set aside a small personal charity fund each year so that i can contribute to my community.	2
in the scheme of things, a life is a life, but i am american and feel it important to help my fellow americans	7
how much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like mim's situation?	5
i would be willing to at least donate a portion of my earnings to help this charity.	9
do you have any kids?	9
they could use some of that money for school supplies.	9
ok, i have donated to them before!!	9
how long are you going to take to respond?	0
now you're just messing with me intentionally.	9
do you know anyone personally who has benefited from charities ?	9
hi there how are you?	9
how can i donate and how much?	9
i hope you get lots of donations.	9
yes, i would be happy to donate to that charity.	9
are there any other charities i can donate to?	9
god bless you.	9
it is not a problem just for children.	0
there is no way to prove where all those funds go.	4
i have heard of that organization.	9
that sounds good.	9
good thanks.	9
it is a big thing to do.	9
yes definitly i am donate in save the children	9
i think it is better to help children yourself.	2
no i have not	9
alright i will donate.	9
you seem partial to save the children.	9
well, most people suck.	7
what do you know about them are they a good charity?	9
why not antartica?	0
i think i have...	9
yes, i would love some information.	9
oh, i didn't know that i just assumed if we reached an agreement before that they would let us advance.	9
i don't believe so.	4
i hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older.	9
have a great day!	9
what kind of things do they help with?	5
so i think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	9
good morning.	9
yes, i will do it	9
that sounds right from what i know.	9
what charity do you usually donate?	9
sounds like a good mission, but i probably won't be able to donate	1
helping children is important.	9
i would like to donate $0.30 today.	9
i think children need help.	9
it's not a huge amount but unfortunately i have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	3
let's save the children together!	9
it is horrifying, i could not even imagine.	9
is it a 401(c) charity?	5
where does the other money go?	5
it's on my to-do list though.	8
honestly i'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	6
how long was the charity been run	5
why yes i have.	9
by the way, what is their site?	5
yes i would be willing to donate.	9
i believe they are our future and should be taken care of in the best possible way.	9
you have a good day.	9
how exactly does the money help the cause?	5
i'll agree to pay half.	9
give me your details i will send you later on.	9
yes, i know about syria.	9
exactly, in today\'s world one must be weary of scammers.	4
hello how are oyu	9
i can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	1
all my kids love their security blankets.	9
you need to type faster.	9
i was glad to hear that.	9
yes, definitely i will donate this year	9
i could also do more research afterwards.	9
i would very much like to donate.	9
not very much of a life.	9
of course i'll donate something	9
oh how would you help the children	5
i too would consider doing it	9
is this an american charity?	5
are you going to donate?	7
john cena has granted 400 wishes!	9
no problem!	9
yes, i try to help time to time	9
just recovering from the long weekend.	9
that is awesome.	9
when iisaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iishould not have ised that term, nor did i mean it lightly, i meant physically donating time and skills.	9
is it a well regulated agency?	5
you are definitely in for warm weather, which is great as far as i am concerned.	9
what do they do?	5
especially with children.	9
it sounds like they have a worthy cause.	9
that really wouldn't bother me at all.	2
i think there are a lot of safeguards in organizations like this one that is set up to prevent such a thing.	9
it was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	0
some charities are run better than others.	4
most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	9
i have in the past, good cause	9
my wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	3
let's both do .15 but split among ronald mcdonald and save the children!	2
nearly 90?	5
that is good to hear.	9
god bless and good morning.	9
it was pretty good, hot weather but still nice and yours?	9
thank you for the information, i think i am ready to donate	9
how can i be sure that it will go where it's supposed to?	5
oh that's great.	9
i know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages.	4
yeah totally agreed.	9
tell me more	5
a friend has been doing it for awhile, and i've always been interested.	9
ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	9
aw, really ?	9
does this charity help children in the united states, or do they deal mostly with children in african nations?	5
i donate to charities often and can lose track of what i donate to.	9
it makes me good	9
do they help kids in the us?	5
yes, i would be willing to donate a fraction of my earnings to save the children.	9
in fact, i believe they were a top-rated children's charity the last couple years.	9
so you dont actually know how they use the koney?	4
doyou volunteer any where?	9
then it looks like we can both really help out.	9
i'd love to help 1000 children.	9
that's very cool!	9
yes, i guess i can.	9
i'm always about children.	9
in turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	9
i would consider it.	9
yes, because it is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	9
okay sounds interesting.	9
i'd like more information, yes.	9
if you give 1 dollar i will also give 1 dollar	7
i am definitely going to donate.	9
i'm doing very well.	9
i wish they were way more specific in the instructions on both ends.	9
i have not tell me about them	5
how much of a donation are you looking for from me?	9
well theres a charity called skateistan that is championed by the famous skater tony hawk and the majority of their donations go to direct service and help children out all of the world whom live in the most vulnerable situations.	9
i almost never donate.	2
yes, fifteen cents	9
i think people fail to realize that without healthy, cared for, nurtured children, our future as a humanity becomes jeapodized.	9
i do it once a year	9
that's so sad.	9
i can donate 5 if you truly are donating 5.	9
or are there any other payment options, as i have bills to pay.	9
on the website?	9
i hope you have a great day as well!	9
i wish i could do something to help.	9
right, but i would like to know specifically what organization.	5
when i really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	9
a couple of organizations claim to do that.	9
oh that's great!!	9
sure i like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others	9
i'll check out that website later.	8
i definitely.	9
how many employees are there?	5
do you live in the states ?	9
i will just go ahead and do the $20.	9
yeah i know that they are helping hawaii now ,	9
sure, as long as you can help me out as well... you see, i have a child that is overseas, in a warzone.	3
yes, for child care.	9
not really, i just try to be helpful	9
i'll start with $1 and maybe give more later :)	9
i donate sometimes well, to other charities	2
i was just about to mention that i never really have donated to any organization.	9
your work is appreciated	9
that is incredible, glad to here this charity exists.	9
it sounds familiar.	9
i always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child.	9
i believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	9
how much money are you looking for?	9
it is a wonderful charity.	9
doing good.	9
that is super important work, obviously.	9
oh really?	9
i want to help in any way that i can.	9
hmmm, let me think about it	6
it completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	9
i happily did.	9
yes i have heard about it.	9
yes, i think i would be will to donate to the cause.	9
thank you!	9
i don't know i haven't found anyone good ones	4
oh i didn't know that.	9
i know it does i'll donate 5 dollars	9
could you provide me with the link	5
right.	9
i live with my parents and i just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which i won't be caught up on until this coming friday.	3
i am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	9
i could give 5 more cents but that is all for now.	9
i believe it is- i've seen commericals for it on tv before....	9
do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	5
okay im fine with that	9
i agree.	9
yea, hello.	9
will you be donating?	9
it is sad, i agree with you	9
cool, so what can i do	9
have you?	9
it makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would i cope?	9
i have.	9
i'll donate 10 cents.	9
what exactly does the charity do for children?	5
no, to be honest i am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	9
sure.	9
no, can you tell me more about it?	5
are there different tiers of donations?	5
they are a great organization.	9
oh yep thats really good	9
it is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country	0
do you regularly donate your time or money to save the children?	9
with that all said i do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children i am more inclined to donate to them than most.	2
i'll give .50 if you send are actually an mturk human.	9
okay, where are the major areas you serve?	5
its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	3
thanks for making me aware of this charity!	9
yea...i am also feel bad that incident...	9
i think it is the important aspect of donating money to charity	9
i am fine.	9
that's really a great cause.	9
maybe 1/2 of the payment.	9
are you familiar with it?	9
nutrition is important	9
i think, biut not sure.	9
yes please!	9
i would like to donate but i dont have a lot of money myself.	3
fine.	9
do you think that small of an amount would really help someone?	9
hi, i am doing well.	9
i have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	9
yes you are right, i help as much as i can.	9
whether to donate or not	9
no, i didn't either.	9
6 dollars is good	9
i think i would donated to donate .50	9
hello, i'm fine.	9
hello, i am doing good, alright lets get started!	9
thank you.	9
no this is my first time.	9
hi i am fine..	9
i did actually, but i can't remember the.	9
i wonder what a reasonable donation amount would be.	9
you have more power than you realize.	9
oh for sure.	9
i have no award in the group.so i have like many children save in our life	9
that sounds extremely awesome.	9
depends on which one you are talking about.	9
