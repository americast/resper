I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.	4
I'l do 20 cents	0
But I would like to give more than a measly $2.	0
That's nice.	0
I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	4
Yeah, what do you think about St Jude's?	0
Children should be our top priority all across the world.	0
It sounds familiar.	0
How much of a donation are you looking for from me?	0
Hey, I am doing well	0
ah, I see, that's very heartbreaking to here.	0
They work in 120 countries already	0
Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.	3
Do you have an amount in mind?	0
That sounds wonderful!	0
I have a needy child of my own, and know how desperate that can make you feel.	4
i think we should all care for children	0
Thanks for the oppertunity.	0
Then I will do it.	0
Tell me more.	0
Every bit helps.	0
Do you work for them or have you donated with them before?	0
I do volunteer some.	0
I have donated a couple of times; like for the St Jude's Hospital, red nose day and March of Dimes.	3
Have you donated to them yourself?	6
Yeah, that sounds great. I love donating to charity. I think it is important to help those less fortunate.	0
Honestly < do not think so.	4
Oh my gosh.	0
Oh, that's totally awesome!	0
They are helpless.	0
okay, that sounds good.	0
I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.	0
I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	9
so have you ever considered donating to a charity for kids	0
how much?	0
I try to teach her about her rights because I think it is so important to know them.	0
No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	0
ok, i also read we have to communicate atleast 10 times for the chat to end	0
How about you?	0
great, yeah i think we can	0
That sounds like a worthwhile cause	0
I happily did.	0
does it have a website?	6
Where are those childrens parent?	0
What are your thoughts?	0
So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	0
ok then i will donate half 15 cents	0
I would consider a smaller portion.	0
That's nice.	0
What is the percentage of donations that go for administrative costs?	6
How are the proceeds distributed?	6
I will donate 50 cents	0
I sometimes question charities that I don't really know	3
That's fine.	0
The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	0
Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	6
It is the least we can do.	0
Thanks.	0
Have a good one!	0
I am willing to match your donation.	0
Clear financial reports are a very good thing.	0
Do you accept monthly donations of smaller amounts?	6
Depends on which one you are talking about.	0
Good morning.	0
I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.	4
Do you mean in the USA?	0
I will take the option of donating into consideration.	7
of course or i wouldnt be online!	0
Great - So how does the donation process work?	6
Aww, that would be so considerate of them!	0
I haven't.	0
I just hope the donation does help and do wish it could be more.	0
Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	0
you too my friend	0
How do you suppose we do that?	9
what other organizations would you consider?	2
Unfortunately I don't have much money right now to help.	4
Yeah, I am thinking about donating half of my payment.	0
I want to help in any way that I can.	0
How do you feel about animal charities?	2
Do you represent them?	6
What are their goals?	6
It's not easy for me to give anything and no charity has ever helped me.	4
How long has the organization been around?	6
No its not.	0
sure, I'll donate $0.05.....	0
yes, i have heard.	0
Yeah, I donate here and there.	0
Yes - someone needs to be looking out for those children!	2
Could you tell me more about the charity?	6
THat sounds good, deal	0
Hello Mike I am Pete	0
Yes, I have	0
Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	0
Words are just words sometimes.	9
You're welcome, is there anything else that I can do to help	0
you do have to be skeptical though	0
I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.	0
I would gladly give my earnings to this charity.	0
I'd be willing to donate $.05.	0
and the money goes complety to the charity or does a part stay for handeling and administration	6
Hi.	0
Yes, thank you.	0
How much of my donation goes to the kids	6
It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	0
You will as well for all the hard work you're putting towards this magnificent charity.	0
I'll definitely check them out.	7
What can you tell me about it?	0
Good how are you?	0
How much many are we talking and how you want me to pay	0
Have you ever donated to children?	2
I may give a few cents	0
I have not heard of Save the Children before.	0
I think so, it sounds familiar.	0
I have.	0
thank you.	0
yeah, i mean, i guess	0
OK.	0
Would you mind telling me about it?	0
to think about all the needs that a child in need at this moment is helping, and to think that this may be their child	0
have you ever done any donation to this charity?	2
Hi.	0
I feel sorry for them and would like to help them as much as possible	0
do they help kids in africa too	6
i understand you , just asking, have you ever heard that some of this kind of charities steal the money?	9
That is kind of you.	0
Very cool, I have heard of them but never looked into them too closely.	0
That sound great but you know my biggest concern with making donations to charities is always the question of just how much of the money I give actually reaches to the intended people.	6
I will donate $0.25	0
I have 10 cents I can give.	0
A little bit but not much.	0
Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	6
I have not.	0
It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	0
Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?	6
When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	0
I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.	0
Yes, I am interested in donating.	0
You as well. Thank you for the chat :)	0
With the commitment I made to the shelter, I would not donate at this time.	1
There are some good ones and some that have turned out to be scams.	0
I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity.	3
Suggestions on a donation amount?	0
I think I would like to see my donation go towards medical care.	0
I was wondering the same thing.	0
I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	0
Should have went for deflection or dismissal.	0
Ok I would like to see if I can help. I love children.	0
What a great idea!	0
terrible thing that happens	0
Well, ok.	0
I am on a very tight budget.	4
Oh, that sounds like a really good charity to donate to!	0
Nearly 90?	6
I hope you still have a good week!	0
this is so good.	0
Oh really?	0
Do they provide food for these people?	6
No, there are other charities that do a much better job in my opinion that I already donate to, such as Compassion International and World Vision for international children's relief, and my local food shelter.	3
I'm pretty poor.	4
Well, don't feel bad.	0
Please tell me about it	0
No, I care aboutkids in my community, who are in poverty.	3
What countries are helped through this organization?	6
Thank you for your time and information!	0
It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	0
oh so specifically in third world countries were they are mistreated or does it include first world countries as well?	0
I'm not sure, what do they do for children?	6
Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	0
One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	0
The reason I ask is because I have cared for abused and neglected children and see the results and how it effects them for the rest of their lives.	0
Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	4
I would very much like to donate.	0
people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	0
I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	0
We are pretty lucky to have been born in the United States.	0
I've given to a few charities before, but never this one.	3
I knew it was a large number, which is one of the things I was thinking Save the Children could help with	6
What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	6
What have you heard people say or have seen online about the charity?	6
Correct?	6
I would.	0
What is the other nonprofit that you support?	0
I have not.	0
if you care for this cause, then me donating my time should be sufficient	0
Okay, well I see that they have an A rating on charity watch with only 13% going to overhead.	9
Same here, but it really feels like a Monday.	0
Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	0
Do you know that charity's mission?	6
How much money a year does save the children raise?	6
That sounds really cool.	0
Some charities are run better than others.	9
Wow, that is intense.	0
We went out with family to eat and are just taking it easy and yourself?	0
Yes - providing funding for children is a top priority, whatever the need may be	0
I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.	1
Yes, and I am sure they will appreciate and need it.	0
OK thanks.	0
are you thinking about donate to the cause?	2
Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	0
what would my donation go toward?	6
I'll keep them in mind and do some research into them.	7
I'm guessing a lot more than me.	4
Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food.	0
What is your favorite childrens charity	0
I like the sound of that.	0
I sponsor through World Vision.	3
Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.	0
Do you donate to any on a regular base?	2
so i donate that charity	0
Unfortunately, it is all I can afford at the moment.	0
Yes.	0
What do you like about them?	6
It was nice talking, thanks for all you do.	0
How long has it been around?	6
It doesnt include extras that all CEO's receive.	9
I worry that my money won't actually go to the children, that it'll just be paying for someone's job at the charity.	9
yes you can you can have my $0.30	0
Oh yes, I have heard that they do very important work!	0
I will look at it in the future.	7
Sounds good.	0
Okay, I will think about it.	0
Good morning, how are you?	0
I will absolutely look to donating something later, just because I have always wanted to anyways and now this so why not.	0
No, I haven't.	0
I definitely agree	0
no i haven't	0
Oh, yes.	0
Yea...It was feel good...what's about you...?	0
I will definitely do that.	0
What would my money do exactly	6
since you are so into helping out kids	2
i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar	3
I usually donate like I would in real life...	0
The life of a child is always worth saving.	0
Well I'm sure there is always more that can be done.	0
Tlk to the people of that country.	2
Yes I have heard about it.	0
thats good children deserve it	0
no, i've never heard about it	0
Bye	0
What a worthwhile cause!	0
Thank you also.	0
I'll pay $0.30 surely	0
Okay,so we are in agreement on the paymentto the charity.	0
Thankyou!	0
have noticed so many kids that are kinder and more aware than when I was younger.	0
everyone should share 5$ or more?	0
If you can promise me that none of the money will go to help ANY Muslim child, then I will donate two dollars from my payment	9
I have never been to the site.	0
Can you tell me more?	0
it is an NGO, yes ofcourse many times I have considered to donate them as per my ability	0
Some what I familiar with charity.	0
That's interesting.	0
If it's a charity I believe in that's a great way.	0
I will just go ahead and do the $20.	0
Oh that's wonderful, what a great organization.	0
For sure.	0
I have a child so i'm all about helping kids	0
That's is good	0
Thank you very much, have a nice day.	0
Yes you are right, I help as much as I can.	0
very good and you	0
no, but i would like to know more about it	6
How about you?	0
Yes, I do	0
Telling me where it goes really does nothing for me.	9
I have not.	0
It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	0
Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	0
I donate a lot of money to battered wives and their children.	0
This will be ten for each of us.	0
Do you have any more information about the organization that you could tell me?	6
I'm certainly willing to listen.	0
Hello.	0
I would be willing to donate 5 cents today.	0
That'd be fantastic!	0
Good day...	0
I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	0
Yes that is very true.	0
I was wondering why you were talking about "save the hold ten" vs. "save the children."	5
I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.	1
I pay money to the Royal National Institute for the Blind.	0
Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	0
SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	0
Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.	0
Yes, I would donate some of my payment to help save children.	0
Do I get a receipt?	0
Very Well, How about you?	0
It is extremely unfortunate that child hunger is so prevalent in this world.	0
I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	0
I would certainly increase my donation if it would be matched since the majority of it is going directly to the children	0
ty..i will contact and agree to start off with 10$ per month	7
I feel like a lot of charities squander the money and don't actually use all the donations for what is promised.	9
from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	2
That's true.	0
And specifically, where does that money go towards?	6
Seems like a great cause!	0
Are you planning to donate today?	0
How long have you been doing that?	0
Wow, that's amazing.	0
My small change won't do a thing for those kids.	5
I do believe you are human based on the conversation.	0
yes it is.	0
Yes, I would be willing to donate a fraction of my earnings to Save the Children.	0
I don't think so.	0
Oh, I didnt know we could do another one?	0
I definitely agree with that.	0
And giving a donation is an ethical choice.	0
How are you?	0
I'm great, thanks.	0
What do you know about this charity?	0
wow how awsome it will really make a difference and i'm so happy we can both help to make a difference (double high five )	0
One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	0
It is very refreshing to see.	0
Good thanks!	0
That's very impressive, I am glad that I am donating this charity now that I know more about them.	0
Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	0
Are you familiar with it?	0
that sounds expensive	4
I had heard about the McDonald's charity and see the change box, but I did not know much about it until a customer told me his son used their services when i was getting food once	0
I'd like to try and donate at regular intervals, like every month.	0
I guess I could throw them .10	0
I will donate within 3 months	7
You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	0
have you?	0
no, i not donated	0
i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	0
The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	0
ok great i have one for you also.	0
I have an idea.	0
Like most people who do mTurk, I do really need the money to pay my bills.	4
I would lock into half.	0
I'll look into the website and likely donate $5.	7
I will donate all of my payment.	0
Thank you very much.	0
yes that would be great I would like to see that	0
Thats awesome!	0
I guess we're supposed to be talking about a children's charity..?	0
You have a good day as well.	0
No, I actually haven't .	0
If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	2
Actually I like these kind of HITs.	0
Do they help kids in the US?	6
A small part maybe.	8
Okay, that sounds reasonable	0
This time I like to do 0.50 since I also know that the charity is legitimate.	0
Have you personally donated?	2
What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	0
Yes, I have.	0
Ok I would like to donate the $20 a month but I would like to hook it up to a credit card that is automatically deducted	0
I'm sorry, but I contributed to save the children back in the day before the scandal broke.	9
Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	6
I don't like to donate to for profit businesses.	9
That is awesome then I will donate $1.	0
I thinkit's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.	0
I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.	3
Sounds good.	0
Yes, for sure.	0
Works better on skeptics.	0
I haven't heard of this one?	0
Would that help?	0
I'll donate right away.	0
Good, What do you think is the greatest social issue we are facing right now?	0
No, I do not have kids.	0
No, I have never hear of it	0
You?	0
Thanks, that is awesome	0
Like only 50% of your donation actually helps children.	9
I wasn't given any information about the charity but am happy to help.	0
I have not but I have to some others recently	3
Nice Talking you.	0
so sad.	0
Send over rights?	0
I already checked it out and it seems pretty good.	0
Mostly working on surveys, so how do you feel about children's charities?	0
I was thinking $20	0
I have.	0
yes i help to kids	0
Is there anything else I need to do?	0
Yes I have heard of them.	0
That is amazing!	0
I'd donate 50 cents of my payment.	0
I live in new york	0
no this is my first time.	0
Awesome.	0
are you going to donate too?	2
I have not heard of Save the Children?	0
If I can vouch for them, yes.	7
i will donate 0.10 today	0
what hobbies do you like?	0
Tha k you so much for the infkrmation	0
how much do you think i should donate	6
What percentage of the donation actually goes to the children and how much goes to the administration of the charity?	6
Can't ever imagine hurting kids	0
All I can afford is $5.00.	0
How many children do you estimate are benefited?	6
Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	8
Okay I'll put it in my quarter if you put in yours and have an awesome day!	0
I glad we can help.	0
Either way its cool.	0
I've heard of them.	0
I'm great!	0
How are you doing?	0
I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	0
When making the donation, what are the steps?	0
What kind of stuff do they do to help the children?	6
As a current nursing student, my goal is to become a neonatal nurse or pediatric nurse.	0
ok got it.	0
That's simple enough.	0
Will the penny be taken from my mturk account?	0
God bless you.	0
Are you going to donate too?	2
Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	4
I think we each have to exchange 10 messages before I can do that	0
Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?	6
Yes, a few times before	0
about the children's charity	0
Ok, that's great.	0
Maybe, I'm not sure.	0
The organization sounds like a good one.	0
I need to think about it.	7
What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	0
I am glad to help.	0
oh - well since it'll be deducted from my task payment - Let's do half - $1	4
If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.	0
that's great.	0
I am well, thank you.	0
What about you?	0
How many total children has the charity helped since it began?	6
Is it an international charity, or exclusive to the US or another country?	6
Thanks for making me aware of this charity!	0
I used to donate to them.	9
Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	6
I think I have	0
There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	9
Do you donate money only?	2
Yes, I do	0
Yes, what would this charity be doing to save the children?	6
VANCOUVER.	0
Okay, that sounds great!Thanks!	0
This sounds really good!	0
Thanks.	0
yes i do	0
Pushiness does not make for a good salesperson.	0
I don't mind donating because I think the money is more important to them than it is to me.	9
this i can do, but i was thinking about actual helping.	0
Oh my!	0
That is great that they are there helping.	0
Sounds like quite the worthy cause.	0
How much do they recommend you donate?	0
Any amount I believe is good.	0
Perfect thank you for the information.Is there a website where I can check it out and donate?	6
Is the donation tax deductible?	6
I'll give 0.1 today	0
I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.	4
one cent then i can	0
My life is awesome and your?	0
I guess that is true.	0
I'm kinda broke at the moment, though.	4
Maybe 1/2 of the payment.	0
yes, I think I have told about my donation and now waiting for the conversation to end.Thanks.	0
you sound very passionate about this subject.	0
yeah me too.	0
Yes.	0
i notice they didnt send money to my child though, he is sick and overseas?	9
What do you like most about this group?	0
Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation.	3
I would like to help in the future when I am more financially stable.	4
You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	0
I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.	3
Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	3
I hope lots of people donate to you.	0
Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	6
That sounds good with me, however now I am thinking perhaps I should donate more, what do you think?	0
I'm glad you understand my concern about scams.	0
I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	4
as per today's earning is very little I would like to donate 1	0
ok sounds good.	0
I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	0
respond with your mturk number and I'll donate .50	0
How do they define "Program services", and do they have independent verification of those findings?	6
okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	3
o.k. task done	0
How do they do that?	6
I'm currently receiving food stamps so i don't buy candy and unnecessary stuff.	5
I am so happy I can help.	0
I\'m not going to donate to some generic "Save the Children" charity with no information.	1
good morning.	0
I am good.	0
Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?	6
62% is amazing.	0
I feel very strongly about "our own children" !!	0
No I haven't.	0
I find it very fulfilling to give back	0
about thousand dollars at least	0
I would like to	0
I'm not going to donate.	1
At least my initial donation.	0
Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	0
ok ill give that	0
thank you.	0
Ok.	0
You've been great.	0
I actually really need the money that I am making from this hit, so I would only like to donate 20 cents	4
I know hunger is a big issue for a lot of people in other countries.	0
I'm glad organizations like Save the Children are helping.	0
Have you ever donated to them?	0
I'd like to look into this charity more before I donate as well.	7
I saw that they have pretty reasonable overhead fees, but the salary for the CEO was very high.	9
you have idea donate to that charity	0
I wish you all luck in that.	0
Any amount of money can help.	0
Yes I believe I will donate.	7
Doyou volunteer any where?	0
There are no facts that prove that to be true.	9
How about you?	0
Clothing?	6
Yes, 2.	0
i'm not sure.	8
It's really hot here too.	0
Yes i believe it most DEFINETLY will make a big impact on others lives and its amazing to see such kind hearted people like yourself do so.	0
Let's make a donation.	0
Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	0
Yes that is an amount I feel comfortable with.	0
I believe in this charity, but still wonder how much of the money I donate actually helps.	3
me too..i see many commercials for charity on TV and it breaks my heart..	0
That's really a great cause.	0
Enjoy they walk, I hope it isn't too hot like here.	0
Thank you for your donation!	0
This is why i would love to donate an amount.	0
yes i have a child	0
Also to abused women.	0
I'm glad you're enjoying it.	0
I'm very sorry I can't donate more tonight.	1
I have seen information about this organization before	0
Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	0
Thank for answering my questions.	0
Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	0
yes I can.	0
I am not extremely familiar with them, but I have seen several ads for them.	0
Yes everything counts, that's how it starts.	0
I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	0
I don't know I haven't found anyone good ones	9
.60 firm.	0
there is no other children charity ?	2
What types of children's rights?	6
All of my payment, the entire $2.	0
I guess I could do that.	0
Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity.	0
hmm..interesting i will consider that..how would i contact them	7
What about Big Brother, Big Sister, they are very much in need of donations	2
I haven't counted but we must be very close.	0
Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	4
in which regions are the donations applied?	6
What do you know about it?	6
Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it?	0
What countries have they been able to help?	6
To church, I return tithes and I also do the offerings	3
Sure	0
I would like to donate about 0.50 to the charity	0
I'll donate 10 cents.	0
Is this donation a one-time thing?	6
I have heard about it.	0
While im in the grave cause I didnt have enough money to buy that bag of chips....	4
Save the Children has not convinced me they can work towards accomplishing those tasks.	9
Awesome.	0
Will you be donating?	0
That is awesome.	0
Not really, I just try to be helpful	0
I have helped at soup kitchens before but that's my own extent	0
Yes, sometimes I feel a little guilty that I have it so easy.	0
What are your feelings?	0
what is the donation for?	0
ok.	0
Thats amazing.	0
Are you connected with the NGO yourself?	2
You have my attention, however this HIT is running Very long for 2 bucks already.	0
yes, it's so heartbreaking1	0
i got it.	0
How do I donate then?	6
Glad they are helping out	0
How do I know this charity is legit?	9
How long are you going to take to respond?	5
I can't imagine not being able to see my son!	0
Good to know.	0
have a great day too	0
I think they might even help in Hawaii with the recent floods, don't you think?	0
Hi, I am doing well.	0
oh thats great i would donate 5 dollars then	0
I wanted to buy clothes for myself today, but I will give them some kind of charity online search, full $ 100	7
Ok done.	0
On the website?	0
Is it a well regulated agency?	6
usually thats how you persuade ppl to donate.	6
I'd rather send the money on my accord, rather than have it deducted.	0
I will definitely check it out	7
Could you tell me more about this charity?	6
Could you provide me with the link	6
I would be glad to make a $10 donation	0
Can you help me with that.	0
ok .60 firm this time	0
I only hope that the money goes directly to children programs instead of being eaten up by overhead costs	9
at the moment i would have to say 0 because i don't know to much about the charity...sorry	2
Thanks for the information.	0
yeah I try to do that too.	0
And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	0
Does this organization spend the majority of their donations on the cause or are the higher ups lining their pockets?	9
I guess in America you don't really understand what other countries go through.	0
I would like to donate $0	1
That would be a charity I would donate too for sure.	0
ok great-who is the research team?	0
What developing companies?	6
I think it's because there are more people who have experienced injustice or have been hurt by inequality.	0
I am from the Midwest.	0
if there is one i support it would definately be this one.	0
I think, biut not sure.	0
Sure.	0
Do you donate/participate in any way to that charity?	2
And thanks for helping!	0
No, I haven't.	0
Great!	0
The website says that 86% of funds go to the cause.	0
I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	0
I have not made a donation recently.	0
So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?	0
I agree.	0
What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	0
Some of them are in school too.	0
Thank you, have a great day!	0
I think it is the important aspect of donating money to charity	0
Even though I can't donate much, at least it will do some good.	4
I agree to 20	0
What are your dogs names?	0
I would love to help them a little bit (as per my ability), it will also helpful for those children to have a better life than the others.	0
I heard a really heartbreaking interview with a Syrian child who lost his dad on NPR the other day.	0
Yes, I absolutely would.	0
I always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child.	0
Wow thats way more than I would have thought.	0
Wow, they really help people all around the world.	0
But that's pretty cool what they do.	0
I'm not sure!	0
What about you?	0
Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.	0
I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	0
That sounds interesting.	0
It feels good to make a difference if only for one child	0
Is that correct?	0
Thanks for sharing.	0
That is incredible, glad to here this charity exists.	0
Will I be getting any sort of reward as well?	6
How can I be sure that it will go where it's supposed to?	6
I could donate 10 cents.	0
I sponsor 3 children.	0
I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.	3
WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	0
Oh yeah defiantly.	0
I'd prefer a secure food donation that directly transports to the areas the children live in instead of handing over to government officials.	3
awesome!	0
I think we have a few turns to go	0
I like to donate $1	0
I'd be glad to support the cause	0
You too,was a pleasure!	0
How does that equate to reporting financial information?	5
But children's charities are great too.	0
What specifically would you like to talk about?	0
Well that is really great.	0
What would you say is the amount of a the common donation thatsomeone like myself would donate.	0
What about You ?	0
If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	6
oh ok thats nice	0
I also have a child, so I understand where you're coming from.	0
thank you.	0
I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.	0
I will donate half of my earnings.	0
no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	0
Yes that is correct	0
Like March of Dimes and the Salvation Army	0
I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	0
I will donate $100 to them today.	0
I'm not sure if I want to, but I can give a little.	8
I'd like to know what specific ethnicity are we supporting	6
Sounds like great work.	0
I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid	0
I dealt with that more when I was working.	0
I'm really passionate about children's rights no matter what background they are from.	0
I have no idea, maybe after we have 10 chat turns each	0
It does.	0
ready to fund.	0
If I make donations now, they are in-kind donations rather than monetary donations.	3
I wish this wasn't true.	0
What exactly does the money do for them?	6
So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	0
Hello tell me something good	0
Would you mind explaining what the charity does?	6
Hello	0
You can find it atURL	0
I would do that	0
Oh ok.	0
Interesting.	0
What is the charity?	6
that is so sad do you work for the foundation?	0
Hurricane season is upon us, so I'm keeping a really close eye on that.	0
I haven't donated to them, which is good apparently.	0
What do we do about it?	0
I would like to donate $.50	0
Thats program services not to the kids themselves.	9
But i think more rich people should come forward to establish such children's charity	2
This is an important cause though.	0
I donate to a dog charity also!	0
if it's what I think they have everything in their hands	0
Are you thinking of a one time donation?	0
I'm going to tell more people about the charity	0
Unfortunately, I have to take care of my kids, too, and can't afford to help more.	4
Yes I understand.	0
i will be working all day.	0
i might donate	8
That would be fine.	0
We sponsor a child in El Salvador, we have been going it a number of years.	0
in what way?	0
Know I have not.	0
Thank you.	0
Like a one time donation of 100$ or so.	3
What are the amounts for monthly subscriptions?	6
I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics	0
How do we end this task?	0
No, anything that catches my eyes, or I find them on gofundme, what about you?	0
do they help kids in africa	6
Fine and you?	0
Complete surveys.	0
yes, that would be great, I like to compare to see.	0
I was thinking to donate around 10 cents for save the children.	0
Definitely, Are you interested in such things?	0
Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	9
Is it a 401(c) charity?	6
Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	0
It's hard to ensure the money goes to the actual children tho	9
That would be something I would do, yes.	0
does it do any work in the USA?	6
hi	0
donating money to them	0
Great!	0
Excellent - how does it work	0
Like mentioned I'm willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cents.	0
Hey!	0
I have and I have heard good things about the charity.	0
OK. Glad that we came to an agreement.	0
Yes i didnt think that it would be this easy thats amazing	0
do you?	0
Gotta feed the hungry first	0
therefore we should do our best to make that happen	0
Thanks.	0
I already work full-time to make ends meet.	4
What a great charity, is there anything I can do to help?	0
no i have not but i am interested!	0
I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam.	9
I am definitely going to donate.	0
Perhaps people could go and help in person, rather than donating money?	2
How are you	0
How long has Save the Children been helping people all over the world?	6
That's a big plus for me.	0
Thanks!	0
I spend a lot of time in the shelter for them too.	0
then unfortunately, i cannot give any money	1
Okay, that is good to know.	0
No i will not until I do further research.	1
interesting.	0
Sure, I would like to help.	0
Tell me more about "Save the children."	6
I'm in a tough financial situation right now so i really need money but i would like to donate.	4
What do you think?	0
Do you have any other questions?	0
Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	0
I do it once a year	0
I was growing up in poverty so i know how it feels	4
Yes.	0
What are you primary motivations for making the donations?	0
I usually donate to animal charities.	3
I think money that goes to kids is a super important cause.	0
Sounds interesting but can you be a bit more specific?	0
how do you have experience with them?	0
What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	6
Why the aggressive tone of me "donating or not"?	0
no, can't say I've been	0
Yes its such a sad thing to see happen myself and family are very kind hearted and feel for all the people around the world who are suffering from this , And would love to make a change and to help .	0
My mother and father both have a PhD so their jobs made possible for us to be able to cover all that and so much more	0
What is the website for Save the Children?	6
I hope so, maybe I can do more in the future.	0
I think that it is so important that the money goes to the children and not to salaries.	9
But I would like to be able $150 to this charity.	0
Like I said those are opinions.	5
Yeah - That would be great.	0
Food?	6
I work with Doctors Without Borders too, glad there are multiple players in the region to help!	3
are you donating?	2
if you give 1 dollar i will also give 1 dollar	2
Absolutely!	0
Take care.	0
What Children's charity would you like to donate money to?	0
Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.	0
Do you have any experince dealing with them at all?	0
Well it is not much but if everyone would give a little it would make a huge difference in this world we live in.	2
Okay sounds interesting.	0
Where can I go to send it?	6
Do I have a choice of how much to donate?	0
NO I do not agree.	2
If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	6
I hope it is not too severe.	0
Its a joy to help.	0
To what age are children receiving help?	6
i like to give out toys and if i have some type of change i give it out	3
Of course nothing gets me more angry then seeing a child warrior soldier.	0
Nice!	0
How do they help children?	6
I mean this is not like sponsoring a child or family situation right?	0
What are some of your hobbies?	0
OK yes I am aware of this organization	0
OK that sounds reasonable.	0
I am hoping that things will change soon.	0
I haven't heard too much about it though.	0
So after making a donation, I won't exactly see how the money I give will be used right?	0
very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children	3
Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	0
I'll donate .50.	0
I do not.	0
Just recovering from the long weekend.	0
Do you donate to children's charities often?	0
They also don't disclose their funds	9
It's all about giving.	0
yes i am are you?	0
not really.	0
what exactly happened to these children's?	6
That sounds extremely awesome.	0
It's been great chatting with you and I hope you enjoy your weekend.	0
I like to donate 50 dollars.	0
How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?	6
I wish I could give more.	0
I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday.	0
yes how do we end it?	0
yes I have in going to donate	0
The thought of that is very exciting.	0
yes like 5 dollars	0
Glad to help	0
I don't believe it.	9
In my personal life I do pay attention to all the details and the reviews of charities.	0
Yes- I've donated to a similar charity before but it was based on supporting kids education	0
It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	0
yes I do	0
I will.	0
I have a passion for children.	0
Oh wow, that's really heart moving, it's sounds like a lovely organization	0
An example would be Uniceff	2
I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	0
They are our future exactly.	0
Not only in the USA, but around the world.	0
I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.	0
Hi, I'm doing OK, how are you?	0
As of right now i honestly would but i dont have the funds for it if their are other ways im albe to get others to donate as well and help out in any way possible i will be more then willing to do so..	3
how much should i give	0
I would like to donate 20 cents	0
thank you.	0
Sounds like a good mission, but I probably won't be able to donate	1
I probably will.	0
Every child deserves to have nutritious food.	0
very intresting	0
we can help them out their physical needs like good cloths, probably orphanage (home to stay)	0
i am not working.	0
How much of the donation will actually be used to help the children?	6
what do I do now?	0
That's a thought.	0
However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	0
I like that information out there.	0
I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.	3
As I recall, for save the children, they were given a bad reputation back in the '90s due to their excessive spending on administration costs vs. program expenditures.	9
Working with kids is the best.	0
That's pretty awesome.	0
That is very generous!	0
What are the donations used for?	6
30 cents for the children is okay with me!	0
If I donate, what do I get in return?	0
I have a passion for helping children also.	0
I see they are top rated charity	0
Wow, that is a staggering amount.	0
I'm so gonna support it!	0
I'm doing very well.	0
More money but I enjoy giving the time	0
That's fine with me.	0
By the way, what is their site?	6
I usually just try to go with half for these things.	0
I believe they are our future and should be taken care of in the best possible way.	0
How do I sign up?	0
i am interesting	0
Awesome.	0
Oh yeah, absolutely!!	0
sound good.	0
At this time I am not willing to do that	1
How about .20?	0
Do they help people here in the USA?	6
I am glad to help!	0
Yeah, I just looked it up.	0
That really is terrible to think about.	0
Yeah - all good things	0
Likewise to you.	0
What types of programs does it offer?	6
I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.	4
Thank you	0
Yes I have- I feel its violence too	0
Hey, is there a limit?	6
I read that their are quite a few places that could use help.	0
I haven't!	0
yes, that is fine	0
Hi!	0
That makes sense.	0
That's crazy!	0
There is so much wasted in the world.	0
OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	0
Nice!	0
So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give "Save the Children" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.	0
is that even worth it?	0
I might want to volunteer too.	0
Yes, I agree.	0
Have you ever thought about the benefits from the donations?	6
Tell me about Bruce.	0
I think Red Cross does a broad array of services	0
Half the payment - One whole dollar	0
The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	0
Definitely, I will donate my $0.30.	0
I think that what is happening with Save The Children is a good idea.	0
Ok i'll check it out.	0
Right on so I will give $0.15:)	0
They seem to be.	0
awareness is less than the more countries so they need some help	0
Happy to help.	0
I completely agree with you.	0
Sure thing.	0
They're asking for $50, I was thinking more like $20.	0
Thank you, I would like to make a 50 dollar donation but first.	6
That makes sense and I do like the money to be spread to everyone.	0
Thats awesome!	0
I could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?	6
That's great!	0
What do you think of children's charities?	0
Helping them is very important as is helping our children here.	0
Are you having a good day?	0
It's great to hear there are people out there doing such important work.	0
I would want to do some research first but that would be a possibility.	7
i understand but i just don't feel comfortable donating yet.	9
Haha.	0
You have a good day.	0
As a parent you want to do all you can for them.	0
I'd rather donate to Ronald McDonald - how much are you donating, though?	3
No, I didn't know that they are helping children near to us.	0
This reminds me of Ronald McDonald as well	0
sure!	0
I don't know that I can donate a dollar.	8
I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	0
Monthly or one-time?	0
They are strictly non profit so we give what we can including clothes and books.	3
I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.	3
I don't have the money right now to donate.	1
yes i am live in us	0
How does the sponsorship work?	6
Let's do that then.	0
i was just looking for a charity to donate to	0
Sure.	0
Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	4
yeah I heard a little bit about on how children are suffering.	0
ok so i will donate $25 to Breed the children right?	0
That's great of you!	0
which charity are you passionate about?	2
hi	0
i dont like it either but we cant do nothing about it.	0
That is amazing.	0
What would motivate you to donate to a children's charity?	0
I use it for things that my family needs.	4
We are here to talk about a childrens charity.	0
And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university	3
What if i'd like to donate more	0
What areas of the world do they cover?	6
Do you know anyone that has worked for them?	6
Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	3
I'm doing well!	0
I haven't.	0
I have given a few extra cents sometimes at the checkout in grocery stores.	3
Agreed.	0
I actually have not.	0
That is fantastic to hear!!	0
hello!	0
Oh!	0
It was great chatting with you.	0
I have not heard about it.	0
yes im looking at it now actually it seems like a great foundation	0
how about .50 cents	0
What type of cause are you in?	0
What are the typical donations to the charity like?	6
What is the name of the organization?	0
How much of a donation are you looking for?	0
I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	0
it is great things to do	0
yeah i did.	0
I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	0
It has been great to electronically meet you too.	0
oh sure, i didnt know i could send that amount.	0
okay done.. thanks	0
do you work for them directly how did you get involved in this?	2
5 percent i would donate	0
Glad I was in a position where I was able to help	0
Thank you!	0
thank you.	0
What is your recommendation on how we can help	0
No.	0
Oh wow, so I could just go ahead and do like $25 million?	6
so do you agree?	0
I have considered donating to St Jude also because they provide life saving medical care.	0
i think one dollar will help	0
Can you tell me more about what they do?	6
I will look at the website after this survey and read more about it..I promise	7
You have more power than you realize.	0
yes thats nice	0
I'd be willing to donate a dollar or two	0
I think it is a good organization.	2
spend lots of money on beer	3
Is there a minimum donation?	0
I dont think there is any shortage of people who need help.	0
I'd rather donate my time or if I do donate money, it will be to a charity that's important to me of my choosing.	3
I am sure there are many ways to help	0
okay, it looks great.	0
I'll certainly review it.	7
Hi there, how's it going?	0
Yes, I have!	0
could you name a couple of examples please?	0
Yes, that would be helpful.	0
I would be interested in donating five cents.	0
Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	0
I little bit of know Save the children life.	0
Wow, that sounds really fun.	0
If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.	0
I'll donate the whole amount.	0
You need to type faster.	0
John Cena has granted 400 wishes!	0
Do they find family's for the children or are they running a orphanage?	6
Heart breaking.	0
I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs.	9
I hope you do as well!	0
Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	0
I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?	6
I would donate $10 to this charity	0
that breaks my heart.	0
I think it's a scam	9
I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.	9
They work with children all around the world.	0
no problem.	0
St Judes is such a great cause too.	3
It's great to earn extra money here and there.	0
I haven't	0
I like to keep my money for now.	1
Yes I donate to a few causes like breast cancer for women, autism awareness and March of dimes for children.	3
The work you do is important.	0
yes please!	0
It is a big thing to do.	0
Hey there how is it going?	0
I understand.	0
Such as?	6
i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	0
I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	0
What do you think?	0
I think it is better to help children yourself.	3
I have!	0
I think we have to complete 10 turns, so here's to another one!	0
I did not know that	0
yeah, horrible huh?	0
I am glad I found a charity I can support.	0
Thanks for your time too.	0
How do they help children in other parts of the world?	6
I work part-time and attend college so I don't have much now.	4
You are very welcome!	0
Good luck to you	0
I'm doing well, a little tired.	0
how do i trust the organiation?	6
100$ donate for group	0
Thank you for your time	0
It sounds like a good idea, but I often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when I donate I do it to causes that I know about.	3
Great, thank you very much	0
Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	0
What about helping children who are living in poverty in America.	2
That is very sad.	0
yeah sure, why not	0
I hope that it makes a difference!	0
Wow, that's very generous.	0
Tell me a little about it, because I heard of it but don't know where the money goes?	6
hello, I have heard of the organization but I am unfamiliar with what they do.	0
Yes, But I donated about 0.20 cents.	0
Thank you for taking the time to introduce me to this charity!	0
Have you presonally donated to them?	9
Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	0
Thank you, you too!	0
wow that is neat	0
ok how about 20 cents.	0
I'd like to learn more information.	0
i need a little more information, if thats not too much to ask?	6
ok	0
I hope that is the case as I hate to read about children in danger.	0
yes i could do that	0
The Children's Hope Alliance in our town provides housing and schooling for children.	3
That sounds like a great cause.	0
I think I would like to donate 5	0
I definitely will check it out.	7
how much should i give?	0
I have a small budget but know any amount matters.	0
I live in the US and volunteer all of the time for childrens charities.	3
No I have not	0
I understand you too	0
How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	9
This HIT is a rip off, taking far too much time.	0
Hi.	0
Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	0
Hey, not feeling really good today, stomach ache :(	0
I see.	0
yeah i know that they are helping Hawaii now ,	0
No thank you	1
>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.	0
how much can i donate?	0
What happened, if you don't mind me asking.	0
Yes I have.	0
Ok, I saw the website and I am willing to donate $10	0
I'm not sure how much I'd be willing to donate.	7
it definitely is!	0
That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	0
First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	0
I would love to donate $.50 cents	0
You too.	0
Yes, most definitely.	0
I wish I could give more, but I am broke	4
No.	0
To make sure that they have all that they need, and more than I ever had.	0
We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	0
I have been to third world countries in South America and seeing the living conditions of some people is very tough.	0
Yes, I think that would be accurate.	0
That sounds great.	0
Just need to investigate them a little more.	8
So tell me about this charity.	6
I see.	0
Those who are really trying to do "good" for others will be more than happy to show proof of where donations are going or at least letting one know how those donations will be put to use.	9
Have a great day!	0
Finnnnnne take the $1.25.	0
Could you QUICKLY tell me about it	6
Do you know of a good one?	0
Yes I do think that they do.	0

But we can always try.	0
I know some of them getreally large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.	0
Can you give me their website, so I can look into them?	6
I'm not certain if that's scripted or not but if it isn't there's a better way to word that and if it is I think the person who wrote it might need to retire because they clearly come from the 50s.	5
But if I die from starvation...its your fault <_<	4
They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	0
Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	6
