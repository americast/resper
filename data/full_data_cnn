I would be	3
I know Syria is a mess recently	5
i'll donate 20 cents	3
would be happy to donate.	3
Wonderful!	3
That's pretty impressive.	3
I would love to help.	3
It makes me feel like life is so unfair, and those of us who can help, should.	3
Have a nice day!	3
Hey	3
On what foundation can I sponsor?	0
It was a pleasure talking to you as well!	3
My families poor too and I don't get a lot of extra stuff like drinks and snacks.	7
I would like to start making a difference today.	3
I'm doing very well.	3
How long has this charity been in existence?	0
What countries are helped through this organization?	0
Thank you.	3
How are you?	3
Not really.	3
The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	3
I honestly had no idea.	1
I have been research the Make-A-Wish foundation.	3
Okay.	3
I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	8
We are pretty lucky to have been born in the United States.	3
New York, how about yourself?	3
yes that would be great i will take a look at it and tell you if i have decided to donate at this time or not	3
Yes, I think I would be will to donate to the cause.	3
That's good to know that they're reputable.	3
Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	3
I was growing up in poverty so i know how it feels	7
I live in a very rural area, people in my town are extremely poor and it still amazes me how they will take what little they have and take care of each other.	3
Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	3
are you donating?	4
Is there a specific age or race of children that Save the Children are looking to benefit?	0
There are thousands that need help	4
So I would definitely be willing to help.	3
I am not willing to donate from my study payment as this money is vital to me.	7
are you based in America? are you an American?	3
How about yourself?	3
I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	3
Yeah, I think mostly everyone has, I think charities are mostly good but I don't know that they always accomplis all they could well, with expenses and all	6
sure i will check this link.	1
Yes its such a sad thing to see happen myself and family are very kind hearted and feel for all the people around the world who are suffering from this , And would love to make a change and to help .	3
Hi, how are you?	3
It is nice to know that!	3
Should have went for deflection or dismissal.	3
That sounds good with me, however now I am thinking perhaps I should donate more, what do you think?	3
It's a good charity.	3
That would be a charity I would donate too for sure.	3
No, I didn't know that they are helping children near to us.	3
How do I sign up?	3
We are here to talk about a childrens charity.	3
I would like to to donate $1.00 as a mturk worker	3
And giving a donation is an ethical choice.	3
Yes that is a common way.	3
hello i am fine thank you	3
I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	6
What is the charity and what do they do?	0
I'd be fine with donating $1.00 though and i'd keep the other.	3
That way nobody can question anything.	3
Sponsorship of a child might be interesting....I'd like to know what my donation is being used for, and that it's actually helping someone.	3
It is really sad that Save a Child exists, the world should be a safe place for children and there should be no need.	3
looking at the link you provided, it appears that children in America also benefit from Save the Children donations.	3
What part of the world will it go to?	0
i'm super broke right now	7
Will the penny be taken from my mturk account?	3
Like only 50% of your donation actually helps children.	6
Some what I familiar with charity.	3
Thanks again for chatting with me.	3
Ok, sounds good.	3
You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.	6
I know its not much.	3
I was just about to mention that I never really have donated to any organization.	3
How are the proceeds distributed?	0
What organizations do you donate to?	4
Tell me more.	3
I recently saw a old movie at the theatre called Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart.	3
I wish you well.	3
I have heard that they work hard to give kids a better life.	3
Wow, that is amazing.	3
Hello, do you have any charities in mind that you support?	3
I agree, how frequently do you donate?	3
even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	0
You are very welcome!	3
yes, it's so heartbreaking1	3
Nice!	3
What would my money do exactly	0
Me too, since I am a parent of 2 children myself.	3
I'm sure Save the Children helps them?	3
I don't think so.	3
Some of them are in school too.	3
That is so heartbreaking.	3
that's amazing!	3
Oh I didn't know that.	3
great, let me check it out	3
So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.	3
This company looks more like a firm than a charity	6
I do not.	3
Thanks.	3
Either way its cool.	3
Do you think that small of an amount would really help someone?	3
No, I am not very familiar with that charity.	0
No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	3
Therefore, we could help the children for their livelihood as well as for their education.	3
Not very much of a life.	3
Do I get a receipt?	3
$0.05?	3
I always donate if it is for children causes.	3
So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give "Save the Children" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.	3
lol	3
That's pretty impressive!	3
And every little bit can add up.	3
Yes most definitely i totally agree with you!	3
yes i am	3
that is very true.	3
i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.	6
how much are you thinking of donating	4
Once I decide to make the donation what should I do next?	3
I could probably donate a small amount.	2
I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	1
It's sometimes hard to focus	3
I think it has to do with helping sick children.	3
It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	3
Yea?	3
Where are those childrens parent?	3
I have not, but there are other charities I like to participate in	8
How exactly does the money help the cause?	0
I will be sure to donate.	3
How are you?	3
Yes - someone needs to be looking out for those children!	4
How has "Save the Children" helped to aid in health, education and safety of the Syrian children?	0
I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	3
yes, i guess i can.	3
I am definitely going to donate.	3
You're welcome.	3
How do I know my money goes to the cause and not just to the pockets of the people that run it.	6
So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	3
I might.	2
It sounds like my money won't be used to directly help the children.	6
Thank you so much, same to you!	3
What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	3
Is the donation tax deductible?	0
What kind of aid do they give?	0
Only in name.	3
Is there anyway that I can be guaranteed the money will go towards what is promised?	0
Yes I know that organization.	3
give me a minute , let me see	1
you do have to be skeptical though	3
Nope.	3
I do, too.	3
You?	3
How can I get involved?	3
I would like to donate about 0.50 to the charity	3
Yeah, what do you think about St Jude's?	3
Me too.	3
I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	3
yes, I would to a good childrens cause	3
Sorry Im getting off topic.	3
I could donate 10 cents.	3
I am somewhat familiar with them	3
If I donate $25, does that go a long way?	3
It's a shame, but I want her to know her rights so that she is never taken advantage of by someone in a higher position of power.	3
What do you dislike about the organization	3
I have been doing some research while waiting for your responses.	3
How do you donate?	3
I would be willing to donate my time and perhaps some money.	3
I will donate I'm just not sure how much.	1
How do I know it is a legitimate charity?	6
do they help lots of kids	0
will you tell me?	0
i think we should all care for children	3
So how exactly does the organization ensure that children's rights are protected?	0
Thats great, Thank You	3
Which children?	3
I would like to help.	3
I already work full-time to make ends meet.	7
I will.	3
Yes I understand.	3
hai whats up	3
As in my weekly paycheck?	3
Yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children	3
Yeah hopefully	3
My few cents would never go toward a children's charity.	9
It's the reason I go to work everyday.	3
Sounds like great work.	3
I have never been to the site.	3
I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.	3
It's been great chatting with you and I hope you enjoy your weekend.	3
have a great day	3
How do I donate?	3
ok that would be fine	3
I'll start with $1 and maybe give more later :)	3
no can you tell me a little about it	0
It sounds like they have a worthy cause.	3
I am fine.	3
I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.	3
Yeah it's very important to help someone that is less fortunate than yourself.	3
i know.	3
I'm sure they do a lot of nice work.	3
Okay, well I see that they have an A rating on charity watch with only 13% going to overhead.	6
Do you have information about their charity rating?	0
Have a great day!	3
I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	3
How much do you usually donate every year>	0
yes i will.	3
I am I am thinking of people here I dont care about the rest	8
Thank you very much!	3
So lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus.	3
If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	3
I'm good,how are you?	3
What country is in the most need right now?	0
I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	3
I'm glad you're enjoying it.	3
I hope you are well.	3
i think i will donate one cent.	3
hello, I have heard of the organization but I am unfamiliar with what they do.	3
You?	3
Oh so they do more than just help with education.	3
Hi, I'm doing OK, how are you?	3
Oh yeah, I donate to world vision, its the best for kids	8
I would like to learn more about this organization.	0
Yes, I would be happy to!	3
yeah, horrible huh?	3
You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	3
hello	3
oh at least a thousand	5
That is incredible, glad to here this charity exists.	3
Well that is great!	3
i am donating .30 cents for your organization.	3
Absolutely!	3
Are you a top rated charity?	0
Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	8
Depends on which one you are talking about.	3
I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	3
Sure I like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others	3
I'm proud too.nice working with you.	3
I will agree to donate $0.15 then.	3
Yeah, it is really heartbreaking.	3
At this time I am not willing to do that	9
Hi!	3
Do you have anything like that?	3
How can i donate?	3
I was unaware.	3
That's very interesting, sounds like they do good work.	3
Yes, that would be helpful.	3
For now, I'm happy with my current donation but maybe another time	1
I'm good.	3
Yes I also like to donate to the children without parents and relatives.	3
Good for you!	3
Thats awesome!	3
Feeling great.	3
Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	0
I think it is better to help children yourself.	8
how do i know money will go to children and it's not a scam?	6
OK.	3
I chose to donate $0.	9
Yes, I definitely understand you.	3
No, I haven't.	3
I don't purchase coffee	5
of course, especially poor children	3
I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world	6
What type of cause are you in?	3
It sounds like a good charity.	3
Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.	3
Do I what with save the children	3
I donate to my local charities, plus the United Way.	3
Do I have a choice of how much to donate?	3
Sure, as long as you can help me out as well... you see, I have a child that is overseas, in a warzone.	7
No.	3
Do you know anyone that has worked for them?	0
Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?	0
Hey, I am fine!!	3
Yes, and then most are willing to provide proof that they actually donated money, so that is good.	3
Ok thank you.	3
That is a great cause.	3
I have not heard of this charity before!	3
I have donated $100	3
Every bit helps.	3
I am aware of the violence in Syria but what has "Save the Children" done to aid in health, education and safety?	0
Oh yeah, absolutely!!	3
That is a good idea.	3
How much would you donate if given the chance to help a childrens charity?	4
That is very sad.	3
have noticed so many kids that are kinder and more aware than when I was younger.	3
There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.	6
Amazing!	3
What Dollar you need to give For children charity?	3
Thats an awesome labor	3
I use it for things that my family needs.	7
nice!	3
yes i do	3
I'm sorry that it seems so little, but as I already donate to an organization and I use the payments here to save for a vacation coming up...	7
it is very happy day	3
Thanks.	3
That is all your opinion.	5
you're welcome, that was fun	3
Hi, it all depends on who you really are, if it's for a person very close to me if I'm willing	1
Hopefully, more the people born more lucky can lend a hand.	3
why is that?	4
And specifically, where does that money go towards?	0
I have not but I have to some others recently	8
Yes, I've heard that before.	3
That's right, how do you help children?	3
What kind of situations do they work with?	0
Okay, I would definitely donate to them!	3
I'd like to learn more information.	3
Your welcome, it is a good feeling to help others in need.	3
Wow that sounds like a really robust program.	3
Oh yeah defiantly.	3
ok so wht do you suggest?	3
Yes I would	3
o.k. agreed 1800 dollares done	3
how about .50 cents	3
I do not feel guilty, did you donate?	4
Have you?	3
What do you do as a volunteer for this charity?	0
Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	3
I work part-time and attend college so I don't have much now.	7
How long are you going to take to respond?	5
I'm afraid for me, their reputation is still bad.	6
Does this money provide help for the kids in their own country or is it used to bring these children over to the United States?	0
I haven't heard too much about it though.	3
Thank you!	3
What exactly does the money do for them?	0
Yes, I am sure.	3
It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	0
Helping children abroad is on my bucket list.	3
I'm not sure!	3
then we have came to an agreement that went vary smoothly it says up top "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made so i think weve done .	3
Awesome.	3
I already read few of their reports on their website.	3
I am well today thank you.	3
I love children and think it's incredibly important to help ensure they are educated, in safe conditions and are healthy.	3
That's awesome!	3
Jude's Hospital In Memphis, TN is an amazing children's charity	3
Oh okay.	3
ok sounds good.	3
Ok. I'll believe you.	3
Believe me, if it were any charity besides "save the children," you could have me donate my entire compensation, which isn\'t really all that much.	6
Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	3
Please tell me about it	3
These days there are tons of people asking for donations for fake charities, it's sad.	3
Do they help children right here in America	0
It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.	3
I hope those kids get the money they need.	3
okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?	4
I'll keep them in mind and do some research into them.	1
I don't know yet.	3
If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	7
ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	3
Yeah - That would be great.	3
there are other charities I'd like to donate to over this one.	8
I don't have any experiences like that but I'm sure it must have been very difficult and scary to go through that as a child.	3
What do they do?	0
I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs.	3
like a quarter here and a quarter there.	3
definitely, have you donated to them?	3
Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	6
I will donate 20 cents	3
Yes, it really does cause feelings of guilt!	3
Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	3
Mostly working on surveys, so how do you feel about children's charities?	3
Yes I have heard about it.	3
Okay.	3
I've heard of it.	3
sure!	3
How much do we have to share with them?	3
I made $100+ everyday last week on Mturk and now all I have left is these low paying surveys	3
NO I do not agree.	4
yes, i have heard.	3
I have a dachsund/pit mix named Tuttle.	3
I have heard about it.	3
I want to give a donation to help them.	3
Ok - so can I donate $20?	3
They are the most vulnerable in society.	3
I think it is the important aspect of donating money to charity	3
anything else i should know	0
But i think more rich people should come forward to establish such children's charity	4
I'm sorry	3
Good, thanks!	3
no, I need to though!	3
Can i donate my time instead?	8
Nutrition is important	3
Even though I can't donate much, at least it will do some good.	7
This will impact my decision on how much to give.	0
oh - well since it'll be deducted from my task payment - Let's do half - $1	7
I think I'd like to donate 0.05	3
That is such a great cause	3
that's good.	3
Thank you	3
Does this organization spend the majority of their donations on the cause or are the higher ups lining their pockets?	6
John Cena has granted 400 wishes!	3
Yes, 2.	3
How are you?	3
Do you know how much of the donations actually make it to children and how much is used for administrative costs?	0
I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.	3
I don't trust the bigger charities.	6
Yes.	3
It is extremely unfortunate that child hunger is so prevalent in this world.	3
I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	3
that's very cool!	3
That is at least something.	3
how much should i give	3
You are welcome.	3
i wonder what a reasonable donation amount would be.	3
Ditto for their problems with the energy company in 2013.	6
Is there any way that I could donate less than a dollar?	3
there are so many starving and abused kids here in the US that I'd feel more comfortable helping them first.	8
I would very much like to donate.	3
so i like that 86% is going to the cause.	3
i do not but hope to some day.	3
I have donated on 2017.	3
Yes I would like to conate	3
Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	3
I little bit of know Save the children life.	3
Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	3
hi	3
That's is good	3
They do a lot for kids	3
I'm not sure that I have.	3
Hi.	3
I think I would donated to donate .50	3
Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity.	3
Yes, that is good with me.	3
no $5 to spend us	3
Hey, kind of tired but overall good.	3
oh thats good	3
Go on...	3
OK no problem I will find out.	3
What countries do they work in?	0
Yes, I would be willing to donate a fraction of my earnings to Save the Children.	3
Sure, Do you like donations?	4
Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	3
Of course I do.	3
Just in my country (United States)?	0
I hope that is adequate and helps them for food and shelter.	3
There are always things in my community that I attend and donate as much as I can and donate my time as well at the local Salvation Army.	8
Hi!	3
Sure	3
I can $1 today	3
As long as my donation gets to the children, I will donate to the charity	3
no i dont think so i love the cause!	3
Education?	0
That makes sense and I do like the money to be spread to everyone.	3
Those who are really trying to do "good" for others will be more than happy to show proof of where donations are going or at least letting one know how those donations will be put to use.	6
I try to teach her about her rights because I think it is so important to know them.	3
Ok, I will do 5 cents of my task money.	3
what do you know about them are they a good charity?	3
I would be interested in donating five cents.	3
Do you know of a good one?	3
Good day...	3
charity is a bad for that.	6
No, I haven't.	3
i would donate	3
What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25	3
I am willing to donate $ 10	3
Yes I am, thank you for asking.	3
.60 still sounds good to me.	3
I do not wish to donate.	9
I work with my local goverment in policy development and people like you really make a great impression on the policy that is created.	8
No, anything that catches my eyes, or I find them on gofundme, what about you?	3
Wow.	3
yeah, that is true.	3
That seems like a really noble cause.	3
Save the children sounds like a wonderful charity to donate to	3
I am still not 100% confident this isn't a scam as it is all done via the computer and not face to face.	6
ok that sounds great	3
Yes I do think that they do.	3
Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.	3
Yes.	3
I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	3
I do have a few questions first.	3
I have, actually.	3
If it's a charity I believe in that's a great way.	3
Yes I have, I think they are from the UK.	3
But I would like to give more than a measly $2.	3
oh sure, i didnt know i could send that amount.	3
oh okay then thats awsome to hear	3
I am not sure I know what Save the Children is.	3
Thank you very much, have a nice day.	3
I wish I could help all the children in the world.	3
I think I have.	3
It was nice talking, thanks for all you do.	3
ok are we to decide annamount?	3
It is great to be a helpful person.	3
I have not.	3
Yes - providing funding for children is a top priority, whatever the need may be	3
I see, and it's called Save the Children	3
credit card? cash?	3
Have a great day.	3
To what age are children receiving help?	0
Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	0
St Judes is such a great cause too.	8
I know they are a well established charity so should have all the resources, administration wise, to get the money where it is needed most.	3
well, it is a charity work / organisation where they save many children	3
I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.	7
When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	3
SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	3
I'd love to help 1000 children.	3
do you work for them directly how did you get involved in this?	4
Oh wow that is good to know.	3
yes i education help for the children.	3
I see they are top rated charity	3
Yeah, you're welcome.	3
I will too.	3
sure, but first i need to know for what need will i donate and what organization	3
I wonder what the member recommendation is for St Jude	3
I guess I would look them up sometime to find out more.	1
I set aside a small personal charity fund each year so that I can contribute to my community.	8
Thanks for the information.	3
I only hope that the money goes directly to children programs instead of being eaten up by overhead costs	6
That's very helpful.	3
I have donated 15 years of my life to charity	8
I do not have any children yet.	3
I'm glad organizations like Save the Children are helping.	3
I'd like to look into this charity more before I donate as well.	1
Have a good evening	3
But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.	7
yes I do,do you as well?	3
I happy to help them.	3
Do you have any kids?	3
Well, is this a lobal charity that will be using my money to spread across their whole organization or will it help buy these children new schools which is a cause that I am really passionate about?	0
yes definitly develop for education	3
I can not imagine food or clothing being a luxury.	3
That is awesome that your friend does that!	3
I'm not a nurse though, and couldn't possibly travel to Africa or anywhere else.	3
yes please!	3
It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	3
I have.	3
I'd like to try and donate at regular intervals, like every month.	3
I tried to give him my food but it was too late	3
That's fantastic.	3
They didn't choose that life.	3
I most likely will.	3
Do I need to do anything else to make sure I get the money donated?	3
Sounds like a blessed organization.	3
Have a great day!	3
I read that their are quite a few places that could use help.	3
Pleasure meeting you too!	3
I cuddle babies in the NICU.	8
there is no other children charity ?	4
how much % of the money that goes to the charity is overhead that will be absorbed and not given to children?	0
How involved are you in the organization?	3
If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.	7
How did you come to find out about this charity?	0
People are more likely to donate when they are comfortable and feel like it is good organization.	3
I guess I could do that.	3
I would be willing to donate $200	3
Thank you for letting me know.	3
hello i would like to help too even its a bit	3
And what do you do at the organization?	0
I've heard of poorly run charities that misuse the donations.	6
I have not.	3
I hope to be able to do that someday.	3
cool i never been how is it??	3
I understand that but how much does the charity keep in order to keep the charity running	0
good thanks.	3
I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	3
That is awesome.	3
I have to respectfully question the necessity -- don't my taxes already go towards billions of dollars of foreign aid?	4
I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.	3
I am an old retired guy with limited income.	7
What is the best organizations and charities for children?	3
I'd rather send the money on my accord, rather than have it deducted.	3
Are you aware of any childrens charities?	3
I'm going to donate half .10 - So i Can feed a child for a day	3
Nice talking to you as well.	3
Time and money donations are really two important aspects for charities.	3
Sure.	3
I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday.	3
I think that is is awful and sad.	3
But its ok, I work every Sunday.	3
so do you agree?	3
I will be honest, what I had heard though wasnt positive.	6
i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount	8
Even though it is only .30 for this hit, with the number of people it adds up.	3
I'm sorry, but I contributed to save the children back in the day before the scandal broke.	6
I'm doing very well.	3
i am alway happy to help	3
That sounds wonderful!	3
That is impressive.	3
Yes, most definitely.	3
I know some of them getreally large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.	3
have you ever done any donation to this charity?	4
Yes!	3
I donate to the NYC Food bank also.	3
I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	1
Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	3
Thank you for telling me about this organization.	3
When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	3
I just can't see doing that.	9
How do they define "Program services", and do they have independent verification of those findings?	0
Have you donated to them yourself?	0
Awesome, good chat!	3
That makes sense.	3
I think I can give $25.	3
What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	0
Makes me feel even better about my donation	3
In fact, I believe they were a top-rated children's charity the last couple years.	3
Wherever and whoever that may be.	3
hi	3
hmm..interesting i will consider that..how would i contact them	1
What charity do you usually donate?	3
It makes me feel that even though not enough I have done a little something.	3
I probably will do that.	3
It's really hot here too.	3
How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?	0
I'm thinking about whether this is better than other charities I give to	2
I am thinking about it.	2
I have.	3
Hi, I am doing well.	3
Ah..	3
It hurts my heart.	3
I do not have children of my own and am not able to have them.	3
yes, sometimes with non profits	3
Super.	3
We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	3
McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay.	3
I propose we stick with our half plan.	3
No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	9
I'm lucky to feed myself and my children, but I believe I could probably manage to send $5	7
I wish I could do more	3
This is so true.	3
That sounds great.	3
How much goes to administrative costs?	0
I just can't see any good being done.	6
Certainly as long as I know the donation will help the children	3
definitely.	3
I'll give 5 cents.	3
I will look at the website.	3
we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	3
I'm great, thanks.	3
Alright, I will donate $1.25, it seems reasonable.	3
The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.	3
Infomercials don't impress me.	6
What is their mission?	0
I was thinking to donate around 10 cents for save the children.	3
That's great!	3
Then in the future, I can donate more.	3
I'd be willing to donate a dollar or two	3
I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	3
i think everyone should chip in proximity 5$ that isin total.	3
I don't even know what the charity is.	0
Thats horrible.. Is this recent?	0
sometimes , it depends on what types	3
I think people fail to realize that without healthy, cared for, nurtured children, our future as a humanity becomes jeapodized.	3
I will definitely be making the donation.	3
You could also mention their rating from the BBB.	3
Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	3
How do I know this charity is legit?	6
I really need the money that i'm earning for this task, so I feel like giving 10 cents to this charity is fair.	3
I am well thank you and you?	3
Great what time is it on?	3
Thank you!	3
that is so sad	3
I like to keep my money for now.	9
It has been a pleasure talking with you!	3
Well that is good.	3
So glad to help	3
not much maybe a couple dollars every few months	3
I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.	7
do they help kids in africa too	0
Thanks.	3
Yes, I have.	3
I will happily donate 60 cents.	3
Yes that is true.	3
I'm not sure yet, maybe 5 cents	3
What does the organization provide?	0
cheers	3
First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	3
How do they ensure that the money is effective in feeding the children and not lining pockets?	6
I am a big fan of organizations who take care of the needs of hurt children.	3
i understand but i just don't feel comfortable donating yet.	6
Well, most people suck.	4
How do people donate to the charity?	3
i am not working.	3
What do we need to work out and what would this donation be for?	3
yes i have	3
hi!	3
How much do you agree to?	3
How are you doing?	3
Thanks for the info I will check it out	3
Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	3
yes I do	3
yes i have	3
An example would be Uniceff	4
i don' known it detailly	3
No, you may not draw that conclusion yet.	3
Maybe 0.50?	3
Yes, and it all adds up at the end of the month especially when you're also struggling to make ends meet.	3
Yes they do.	5
that's really good to hear!	3
I'm glad they do that but there are many charities that claim to do the same thing.	4
You have a good day.	3
How do you know that they are effective?	6
seeking job	3
I can not donate until 10 chat turns.	3
I definitely agree with that.	3
well I have to go to work in a little while here how about you?	3
Great!	3
What are the amounts to donate?	3
How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?	0
I will do $10 to both.	3
Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	3
What types of programs do they offer?	0
I didn't realize that.	3
Yes, I do	3
well if you aren't going to help me out with information and make it easy on me by helping with info, i'm not sure if you really care	4
It would feed a child for almost 3 days.	3
Hey, not feeling really good today, stomach ache :(	3
Me too, if only we could help!	3
i just don't know why i've never heard about it	6
I have a small budget but know any amount matters.	3
I feel like they'll just take my donation and get their tax credit.	6
I am trying to understand how it is decided what child in need gets the help.	0
Where are you at?	3
I think every little bit helps but as a whole it's not enough.	3
How long have they been around?	0
Do you?	4
The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	3
okay did you choose to donate?	4
I think I would like to see my donation go towards medical care.	3
I would like to donate	3
Is this an American charity?	0
But do you really trust the charities that you give to?	6
That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	3
Well that is really great.	3
Oh i see.	3
Or a whole lot of bandages.	3
Sure, I'd love to hear about it	3
That was interesting, it seemed to match the information on the independent review site.	3
I don't make a lot.	7
I sometimes question charities that I don't really know	8
I already help an organization but would be glad to help another one too.	8
6 dollars is good	3
hi how are you	3
I am doing fine, thanks for asking.	3
what is the organization ?	0
Wow, that's amazing.	3
I don't mind donating because I think the money is more important to them than it is to me.	6
Hmm, I see.	3
I haven't yet, but I am thinking about doing so in the future.	3
I believe its a Christian organization.	3
Do they?	3
i will like to know about the opportunity first	0
In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	3
Thank you also.	3
Have you ever made a donation to Save the Children or another charity?	4
That is very awesome.	3
I usually donate like I would in real life...	3
A request by a children's charity for a donation.	3
With e environment and food system.	5
Where, on their website?	3
Hi!	3
I really appreciate your willingness to go out on a limb.	3
Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	3
What kind of payments do you take?	3
Hopefully it is for a good cause and not just a waste.	6
So you dont actually know how they use the koney?	6
Correct?	0
Well, don't feel bad.	3
Do you work for them?	0
Helping them is very important as is helping our children here.	3

Do you know anyone personally who has benefited from charities ?	3

I am good with donating $10 right now.	3
I would gladly give my earnings to this charity.	3
I would like to donate 20 cents	3
Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	3
Do you know of any other childrens charities?	3
I dont think there is any shortage of people who need help.	3
Health and education both are important factors	3
What happened, if you don't mind me asking.	3
The photo would be nice, it would let me know and connect with someone I am helping.	3
what would you suggest?	4
0k Here is a .25	3
you too my friend	3
Sorry I can't donate more :(	3
I could maybe do less as well?	3
Not today but I'll definitely save the website for the future.	1
What types of children's rights?	0
Especially for third world country that have limited resources	3
Absolutely!	3
I hope you get lots of donations.	3
Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	3
What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	0
I already checked their website.	3
I do volunteer some.	3
That sounds awesome.	3
I'm not - Could you tell me more about it?	0
I am not sure I am just very biased	6
I am glad to help.	3
I give £3 a week so around £36 a year.	3
Sounds like they accomplish great things.	3
If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	3
I think I would like to donate 5	3
No, I have not heard about that charity.	3
I would like that.	3
On my side I don't have information about the task, only that we are trying to come up with a donation agreement.	3
I'm good with them doing that.	3
I will happily donate my whole payment for this task. :)	3
Are you going to donate?	4
Interesting.	3
Yes I would be interested in doing so	3
But, I choose my own charities independently.	8
Thank you for taking the time to introduce me to this charity!	3
And you too.	3
I am curious why you chose the words "rural America"?	3
What is the other nonprofit that you support?	3
OK I will educate myself on them when we are done with our conversation.	1
They are strictly non profit so we give what we can including clothes and books.	8
yes I can donate.	3
Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.	3
I'll donate half of that.So $1.	3
Probably more.	3
My pay?	3
What do you know about it?	0
Is this the same group where people used to "sponsor" a child?	0
How do they go about providing relief to the children?	0
so have you ever considered donating to a charity for kids	3
with the hurricane coming soon.	3
No.	3
Thank you for donating your time to the cause.	3
That's simple enough.	3
thank you.	3
I have to go to work at 11:30-6.	3
I am glad you were there to help him.	3
I hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older.	3
At this time I can't donate any amount.	9
Are you having a good day?	3
about the children's charity	3
That's so horrible.	3
you have been great.	3
Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	3
Thats such a noble thing they are doing	3
of course i would donate, how much are you willing to donate?	3
I don't have a lot of money, but I'll ask my family and friends to donate to them for my birthday.	3
I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.	3
actually i have a kid that is sick and overseas right now	3
well, I'm glad to hear such a good news from this organisation.	3
thanks so much!	3
I like that information out there.	3
Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	3
yes that would be great I would like to see that	3
work here is the other thing, my donation comes from my other payment	1
Great, thank you very much	3
just not sure i'm willing to donate 0.50 cents	9
Very welcome.	3
i understand you , just asking, have you ever heard that some of this kind of charities steal the money?	6
hello.	3
Charities need regular support.	3
yes my home in 3 childrens i take for in the life	3
I do	3
i usually do donate to charities	8
great you too	3
My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.	3
I have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.	3
What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	3
Great.	3
You are welcome.	3
Thanks for sharing.	3
If we can get a group of Investors this organization can reach a larger spectrum	3
sure can you send it to me	3
about thousand dollars at least	3
Maybe ten dollars I can do.	3
Yes I do.	3
I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	3
I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	3
Do you have an amount in mind?	3
I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	6
i will be working all day.	3
You seem partial to save the children.	3
It's on my to-do list though.	1
Yes, I try to help time to time	3
What percentage of the donation actually goes to the children and how much goes to the administration of the charity?	0
I would do that	3
Thought this was hypothetical.	3
So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?	3
I do not purchase candy too often; however, I could definitely sacrifice a Starbucks Coffee to help children in need.	5
yes i know that is a good charity foundation, they help the children.	3
I know, it always amazes me how many children are suffering around the world.	3
I do what I can in my own community and the town comes together this time of year to make sure each child has school supplies.	3
How long has Save the Children been helping people all over the world?	0
Whats their overall goal?	0
It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money.	6
OK.	3
I can imagine, that is horrible.....	3
It really breaks my heart. I wish I could help everyone in need.	3
What is the total revenue?	0
this i can do, but i was thinking about actual helping.	3
God bless!	3
Are you thinking of donating to it?	4
In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	3
Ok well I know it is important for them to have basic needs.	3
Oh, that is nice!	3
I don't have much money for myself either which is why I consider this to be my part time job.	7
Its a joy to help.	3
I'm glad there are people like you out there who are attempting to make a difference in the world.	3
I would like to donate	3
Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.	8
A friend has been doing it for awhile, and I've always been interested.	3
I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.	2
they really doing a great job..	3
very intresting	3
Unfortunately some "charities" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.	6
Donate to what charity?	3
What are your thoughts?	3
Yeah, I like the name, I am curious about it, I would like to know some morea about it.	3
HI	3
Have you donated to Save the Children before?	3
I would love to do that.	3
I think I will donate $1, it only seems fair.	3
chicago.	3
That would be something I would do, yes.	3
How about yourself?	3
Hi, I currently have a children's charity that I sponsor	3
I understand.	3
Yes, It's an is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	3
The explanations you provided were very useful.	3
You have made this a good learning experience and I feel confident in my donation to Save The Children.	3
I am glad I can help in anyway that I can.	3
Well the have a great cause.	3
It sure does.	3
The way things are going I don't expect to experience any thing close to that again.	5
oh yep thats really good	3
one cent then i can	3
I too would consider doing it	3
ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries	3
Thank you, I will do it for sure, have a nice day	3
yes, i am interested but now not join in children's charity.	3
Let me ask, are you also able to donate, and if so how much are you able to spare?	4
i might donate	2
It depends, should this be a monthly donation or annual?	0
I agree with you!	3
let's do 1	3
What do you like most about this group?	3
Fine, thank you.	3
I would love to make a donation today.	3
Perhaps people could go and help in person, rather than donating money?	4
Sad but true.	3
I don't know that I can donate a dollar.	2
Then it looks like we can both really help out.	3
I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	3
I think I have heard of it.	3
Please tell me more.	0
That's crazy!	3
Sounds great. Is there are reason that you have chosen to raise money for Save the Children?	3
Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?	3
I would certainly increase my donation if it would be matched since the majority of it is going directly to the children	3
I also send him little care packages every so often.	3
What is my payment for this task?	3
no Ill donate to local charities	8
I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	3
hi,it was another day	3
Hello Mike I am Pete	3
Thankyou!	3
I used to volunteer often, but I have so little time it feels like now!	3
thank you sir.	3
I have!	3
Thank you so much.	3
Do you take credit cards?	3
you have idea donate to that charity	3
I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	7
At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.	8
Like I said those are opinions.	5
if you care for this cause, then me donating my time should be sufficient	3
where was it locate	0
which charity are you passionate about?	4
Tell me about Bruce.	3
Thats amazing.	3
I'm not sure how this donation process will work, do you know the specifics?	6
I think it is also the right thing.	3
No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	3
No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	3
Do you regularly donate your time or money to Save the Children?	3
Good to know.	3
I'm really sorry.	3
Okay, I will make a donation for $10.	3
I agree.	3
Same here, but it really feels like a Monday.	3
no, I do not wish to donate at this time.	9
Do you make donations on line or mail it in?	3
without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	3
Are we supposed to mutually agree to both give a certain amount?	3
thank you so much!	3
So children's charity then...	3
But if I die from starvation...its your fault <_<	7
I would like to donate today.	3
And a few other local charities specifically for children.	8
oh ok. i love children's very much.	3
Wow that's a really great rating!	3
I also like to save the children.	3
This is why i would love to donate an amount.	3
If I'm in the right place at the right time or am given an opportunity.	3
hello!	3
well, I can't imagine anyone would much less a child....	3
I'll pay $0.30 surely	3
It seems like they're involved in a lot of areas.	3
5$ sounds good ok	3
yes like 5 dollars	3
Yes I have in the past, but not recently	3
How would this donation be made?	3
Yes, of course.	3
I see.	3
Many of them lives on a war zone	3
No, I didn't either.	3
Oh wow, that's really heart moving, it's sounds like a lovely organization	3
I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	3
Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	3
I would like to dotate $0.20.	3
Have a good day!	3
I wouldb but I don't have any money right now.	7
Which countries do they work in?	0
well that would be a good but I would want to research them first to make sure they are good but maybe you have already done that	8
Im a perfect world where I had all the resources and money I could stand, I would love to be a philanthropist.	3
I like the sound of that.	3
What areas of the world do they cover?	0
I used to manage a store and we often picked childrens charities to give to.	3
I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.	9
Oh absolutely!	3
I have heard about them.	3
Thank you so much for telling me about this.	3
Oh I see so they have a website that I could learn more about them.	3
I'd rather give to Ronald McDonalds especially since I know people who have personally benefited.	6
I dont know much about this charity....what else can you tell me about it	0
Clothing?	0
I agree, it has been very nice chatting with you and I hope you have a great day.	3
nice i like this group for many children save in the world	3
It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.	9
Wow, they really help people all around the world.	3
I will donate a portion of my payment.	3
What exactly do they do?	0
I also agreed to donate but before that I need more information, why do you keep asking me to donate?	3
I have a child so i'm all about helping kids	3
No, I care aboutkids in my community, who are in poverty.	8
Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	3
Ok, good to know!	3
If they don't, it's completely understandable.	3
That really is terrible to think about.	3
Yes pleas do	3
I would like to read a little about the charity before donating.	2
That's awful.	3
do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?	3
You sound very passionate about them.	3
But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.	3
Am so glad to hear that	3
The thought of that is very exciting.	3
How long has the organization been around?	0
sure, what's the website?	0
I am not sure about where all the donation money ends up.	0
I agree.	3
I don't eat candy.	5
That's really awesome, are they more in need of supplies or monetary donations?	0
no I have not...what is it about?	3
I can't donate less than 0.50?	5
You are definitely in for warm weather, which is great as far as I am concerned.	3
What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	3
Oh wow!	3
Yes.	3
I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!	3
How many years has Save The Children been doing charity work?	0
How long has it been around?	0
Wow that is wonderful.	3
I never know who is in charge, who is taking what, and where the money truly goes.	6
What are they about?	0
I have not heard of that charity.	3
Thanks for the oppertunity.	3
I don't think i've heard of that.	3
I typically give to local charities that use the funds to help in the community.	8
Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	0
yes i like to give out things	3
That's true.	3
I would definitely love to donate and get involved in any way I can.	3
That is a great way to think about it.	3
i like to give out toys and if i have some type of change i give it out	8
I believe my money should first focus on children in need in this country.	4
Where in the world are the children located?	0
That's fine.	3
I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.	8
we can help them out their physical needs like good cloths, probably orphanage (home to stay)	3
Yes, I have.	3
I want to help in any way that I can.	3
I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	3
They save miniture IG dogs.	3
people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	3
Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?	3
Same here.	3
That sound great but you know my biggest concern with making donations to charities is always the question of just how much of the money I give actually reaches to the intended people.	0
Some charities are run better than others.	6
Oh, that's totally awesome!	3
I'll still do $20 and go through the site.	1
This is true but alot of charities don't represent the individuals they portray to help.	6
Can you tell me about it?	0
Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	2
I understand that, and you guys raise money here on this site?	3
Agreed, which is probably what they want.	3
I feel very bad for the children in Syria.	3
Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	3
Hello, I'm fine.	3
What service does this charity provide?	0
Are you willing to match my 10 cent donation to Save the Children	3
How does a person go about making a donation?	3
Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	3
I believe they are our future and should be taken care of in the best possible way.	3
I have never sought out a charity and that brings up a good point.	3
What is the percentage of donations that go for administrative costs?	0
The Red Cross and Greenpeace were my main charity donations this year	8
okay i will donate $1	3
I do too	3
What about you?	3
God bless you.	3
I'll donate right away.	3
I'm doing well thank you	3
it's so heartbreaking	3
Do they help people here in the USA?	0
ya fine morning what about you	3
I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	9
Is it just in one country, or do they work around the world?	0
I hope that is the case as I hate to read about children in danger.	3
I like to be able to help as many as possible	3
I would like to go to some of the countries and help in person too.	3
It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	3
.60 firm.	3
Awesome.	3
if there is one i support it would definately be this one.	3
Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	0
That is all i can afford	3
That is terrible.	3
And share on social media could be the next step?	3
Oh, in answer to your first question I have not done a task like this before.	3
You are welcome.	3
What is the charity?	0
Do you represent them?	0
Wow thats great.	3
I like to donate $1	3
You too	3
to think about all the needs that a child in need at this moment is helping, and to think that this may be their child	3
And you?	3
oh yep thats very good i know these children needs help for sure	3
ok how ill give that much	3
How much will you be planning on donating to the charity?	4
awareness is less than the more countries so they need some help	3
That sounds like an awesome organization!	3
I am interested to help.	3
It's cloudy a lot, but otherwise fine.	3
Enjoy your day also.	3
And you?	3
Yeah, totally.	3
who do they help	0
It's a very noble cause.	3
Tell me more about "Save the children."	0
I could also do more research afterwards.	3
yes how do we end it?	3
Good, so what's up?	3
Yes it is hard to tell whose interests really lie in the movement they promote.	6
yes everything is high priced	3
I am from USA.	3
I see, can you go into a little bit more details about some of the childhood related causes ?	0
You as well. Thank you for the chat :)	3
yes i am	3
Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	3
I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people	8
How can you assure me?	3
Honestly < do not think so.	7
not really.	3
Good morning!	3
I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!	3
What does Save the Children do?	0
Okay.	3
I'm not going to donate.	9
after i die i will donate my all..	7
Most definitely doesand hope it will make someone else feel 10 times just as great	3
I am well, thank you.	3
Thats sad so many children were killes	3
Yes, I agree.	3
no, i've never heard about it	3
I've had similar things happen.	3
The life of a child is always worth saving.	3
Save the Children International's CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt earned $299,136 in 2017.	3
do you mean autopay from my payment checks ?	3
That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	7
Are the children in need all across the world?	0
Is this organization Christian or religious based?	0
What a great idea!	3
mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.	3
Let's save the children together!	3
It is a wonderful charity.	3
I do not want to make a donation today.	9
I'm just waiting until it's time to go volunteer at a local children's hospital...	8
I never heard of them before today, have you?	3
Thank you!	3
I understand.	3
oh ok, who is they?	0
I would like to	3
Does your organization provide receipts, for tax purposes?	0
Most people wouldn't give anything and it makes me really happy to meet someone that would help with whatever they can.	3
Glad to help	3
No there is not	3
I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.	7
I'm like you.	3
good how about you?	3
Not exactly, but I'm sure it's thousands	3
weell that sounds like a lovely charity.	3
I think the charity sounds pretty good.	3
It does.	3
Helping children is important.	3
Very cool, I have heard of them but never looked into them too closely.	3
I reviewed the site quickly.	3
Hi	3
I can spare a quarter if it helps.	3
I've heard good things about Save the Children.	3
I choose 0.30 dollar for donation	3
So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.	8
if it's what I think they have everything in their hands	3
I did not.	3
Nice, I hope it's not too warm this weekend	3
I do enjoy donating to charities.	3
I usually just try to go with half for these things.	3
I may give a few cents	3
I seethank you for your information.	3
No i am not can you explain?	0
Today is beautiful!!	3
What do I need to know about them?	3
I don't personally I have a niece, and lots of cousins	3
That sounds like a very nice cause.	3
Sounds good.	3
it makes me good	3
yeah me too.	3
I do it once a year	3
I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids.	3
Do you believe they don't?	3
Yes I would	3
I will spread the word!	3
I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.	8
So, I'd be willing to donate, if I could confirm the charity was a legitimate one.	6
What type of people or who manages this fund?	0
Ok, that sounds good.	3
Would you give some of that .15 to Ronald McDonald?	4
I heard that some bad weather was going to be coming.	3
does it have a website?	0
I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	3
That is very interesting.	3
Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.	3
And how is the charity promoted?	0
Yes it is.	3
That's good to know.	3
Hm, it depends on my schedule to be honest because I still have to pay rent and I don't have set hours but I'd be willing to give around $100 if I have solid hours every month.	7
how can i help them?	3
Our HITs are going to expire on us.	3
What specific causes the charity donate to?	0
Could you explain to me what the 25$ will go to exactly, is it for building houses, farms, shelters,...	6
well, I've already promised 10.	3
Both of my parents were employed and were able to provide for me and my siblings.	3
You're welcome, is there anything else that I can do to help	3
You're welcome!	3
Have a wonderful day.	3
Is there a minimum i can donate?	3
They also don't disclose their funds	6
Okay, so we are in agreement on the amount and donating, what else do we need to discuss?	3
Okay, that is good to know.	3
Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	3
Those less fortunate deserve better.	3
of course i would, its the least i could do to help the children in the world.	3
no, but i would like to know more about it	0
No problem. I do understand how every little bit helps and how we do not have to give as much if we can get others involved and for a good cause.	3
WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	3
Although that one is easier to spin as seeking more money to fund more projects.	5
Yes, thank you.	3
It is not a problem just for children.	5
That is kind of you.	3
Oh!	3
I mean this is not like sponsoring a child or family situation right?	3
I always think about how I would want to know my child is cared for if I'm not around.	3
I hope you continue your donations.	3
Okay,so we are in agreement on the paymentto the charity.	3
Really?	3
interesting.	3
I can't work all day.	7
I not sure, how many children are in need of a donation?	0
How much would you donate?	4
I assume save the children would be able helping children in three world countries.	3
hi how are you today	3
no i havent	3
I think that what is happening with Save The Children is a good idea.	3
Of course nothing gets me more angry then seeing a child warrior soldier.	3
What kind of camera do you have?	3
My kids are 4 and 7.	3
no i dont	3
Ok great.	3
I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	3
Hey, is there a limit?	0
Well, it's been nice talking to you.	3
I am contemplating adoption for the future.	3
Great, and can i bring family members to the donation event?	3
half would work for me.	3
Are you going to donate also?	3
Hello, what do the Save the Children Federation do?	0
Is this a legit charity?	6
And the fact that not much of the donation actually get to the "cause".	6
I haven't donated to them, which is good apparently.	3
no, i not donated	3
Yes I have 2	3
I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	7
How do I donate then?	0
My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	7
I would like to, but I really can afford to donate anything right now.	7
If I did have extra money, I would probably donate to St Jude's.	8
They have no choice but to rely on others.	3
I would want to do some research first but that would be a possibility.	1
You've been great.	3
I can't imagine what they are going through.	3
I think I'm okay.	3
What sort of assistance do they offer specifically?	0
Haha that's true!	3
i am interesting	3
Maybe 1/2 of the payment.	3
Thank you for linking the website, I will check it out right now.	3
what do I do now?	3
I definitely agree	3
Right.	3
I work hard to help children as well.	3
I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.	3
How are they rated as a charity?	0
Yea, I think thats most important.	3
What is the name of the organization?	3
good morning.	3
What was life like for you growing up?	3
Do I get anything for donating?	3
Which is why i trust them.	8
thank you and hope it helps	3
I hope that it makes a difference!	3
It may -- but at this point I really still have no idea what Save the Children is and I would want to research it anyway before I would agree to give money to it.	1
Yes I would like to make a donation.	3
Yes I do, but I'm happy to donate to yours as well!	3
As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.	3
Thank you for your generosity!	3
Not only are they ravaged by the volcano, now a hurricane.	3
Sorry	9
Working with kids is the best.	3
you make me feel sad :( it hurts me to see the picture of the children, I want to donate everything	3
ok got it.	3
it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.	6
yeah i did.	3
That is terrible.	3
I am unclear as to whether or not this is a real donation or just discussion for the sake of the task	6
Much better.	3
I like the sound of that!	3
Thank you, you too!	3
Oh cool.	3
It was really nice chatting with you.	3
Okay that sounds nice and an important service	3
I do believe you are human based on the conversation.	3
If a child would like to send me a letter and picture of theirselves, I would be delighted.	5
I hope everyone does.	3
I have not!	3
hi there!	3
What can I do to help?	3
i love that so much of it goes towards the children	3
Ok I would like to see if I can help. I love children.	3
I am poor and I can relate to the children who are also poor.	7
This is an important cause though.	3
Okay I will be sure and research the organization to better understand.	1
We could donate our earnings from this hit and still make a nickel for kibble.	3
I am so glad to hear that!	3
You are very welcome.	3
I appreciate you trying to get me to though.	3
Oh wow, shocking news.	3
Do you participate in any local children's charities?	3
I need the money as well	7
I guess I could throw them .10	3
I want to help the children irrespective of their color and creed.	3
Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	0
I definitely.	3
What have they done in the past?	0
How do I donate?	0
No problem!	3
Sounds like a good charity.	3
I can't imagine not being able to see my son!	3
yes.	3
I can spare $25.	3
You gotta make sure your donation is helping the needy.	6
Not really, I just try to be helpful	3
very good, do you think they may just get the money and dont help no one?	6
I don't think so.	3
I am so grateful there is a way for me to help financially!!!	3
It's all about giving.	3
Exacally if 50cents can make a differnce in someones like and i can help im all for it !!	3
I'm good, how are you doing?	3
What do they do to help children?	0
whether to donate or not	3
Congratulations to them.	3
Before I can donate I will need to know how this organization has help.	2
nope I have never heard of it	3
Yeah stories like that are very heart breaking.	3
You too!	3
Well, that's a noble cause don't you think	3
I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	3
Ok. Utilizing the resources from the research team, what are some challenges for children's education in developing countries?	0
Ok, you too!	3
Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world.	3
Well it is not much but if everyone would give a little it would make a huge difference in this world we live in.	4
Are you a cubs fan?	3
They want to make sure it doesn't happen to the ones that come after us.	3
Hey there how's it going?	3
Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	3
thanks	3
I forgot to ask, how is the weather by you today?	3
Why are you talking about this charity instead of the others?	4
Do you work for them?	3
Or are there any other payment options, as I have bills to pay.	3
I was thinking $20	3
Good morning.	3
No problem.	3
Thank you.	3
I have not.	3
I think children deserve all the help they can get.	3
I was not aware of that fact, no.	3
What can we do to help?	3
It has been great to electronically meet you too.	3

Yes, I like to help whenever I can when it comes to children.	3

that breaks my heart.	3
Yes, Definitely i will donate this year	3
That sounds good.	3
I do donate to Ronald McDonald House and St Jude.	8

It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.	3
Wow, that is extremely sad.	3

Nope.	3
I think I'd be willing to donate about 25 cents	3
Do you have any kids?	3

Make a wish is really cool.	3
Good luck with your charity	3
Sure, what is it?	0
Im pretty sure that if you want someone to donate to a cause you treat them nicely	3
Honestly, it should be a choice.	3
ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	3
Specially kids in need.There are some living in very bad conditions	3
But children's charities are great too.	3
Wow, that is intense.	3
By the way, what is their site?	0
Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity?	3

Yes I have- I feel its violence too	3
No thank you	9
Oh, from my personal account?	0
I'm doing well!	3
oh i love kids i know they need help	3
I heard a really heartbreaking interview with a Syrian child who lost his dad on NPR the other day.	3
Personally, transparency is especially vital.	3
As you can tell, it's something I'm very concerned about!	3
Do they provide food for these people?	0
Is it a 401(c) charity?	0
That is fantastic to hear!!	3

Yes, I have two.	3
Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	3
Now you're just messing with me intentionally.	3
They work with children all around the world.	3
no i havent	3
Children are the most vulnerable people in our society.	3
Againwhatroughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	0
i dont know	3
I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	3
If I donate to this charity your talking about I need to know the name and information to agree to a donation	3
oh wow, that sounds important	3
I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	3
I'm not doing half I'm doing a third.	3

I am ready to donate today and would like to know an acceptable donation.	3
What encourages you to donate monthly	3
what is a recent successful program?	0
Ok.	3
are you involved with charity	0
Did you ever use the services of any organizations for children to help you through the rough times?	3
Be the change you want to see in the world, right?	3
Would 60% of the task payment be enough?	3
it definitely is!	3
I hope you enjoy!	3
That would be fine.	3
Thank you!	3
That sounds pretty good.	3
doing good you?	3
However, that is only salary.	3
30 cents for the children is okay with me!	3
What is the organization called?	3

Id like to make a donation, how do I do that	3
Sure, please tell me about the organization	3
I'm glad we good agree on a charity to donate to.	3
What's Save the Children all about?	0
Sounds good, please feel free to share!	3
Okay.	3
I do have a soft spot for children.	3
Are you thinking of donating to it?	4
Did you have any worries about food, shelter, safety, etc.?	3
If it makes you happy, go ahead and take .50	3
Your perspective is helpful.	3
You are really helping our country's children.	3
Do you donate to this charity?	3
I understand you too	3
Oh, really?	3
Hello!	3
Likewise to you.	3
Ok good to know.	3
I don't know which one and presumably talk about a donation to said charity.	3
That sounds like a decent organization.	3
I have not.	3
Oh!	3
That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?	0
Exactly.	3
There are many charities for children than just that one.	8
Yes- the war in Syria had traumatized many children	3
I have but I can't say I am very familiar with what they do.	3
What does 5 dollars get these children?	0
you too!!!!! :D	3
is there an upper limit?	3
what?	3
pretty good, you?	3
I'd rather donate my time or if I do donate money, it will be to a charity that's important to me of my choosing.	8
It's good to be able to help someone else out and have it be easy and painless.	3
If you can promise me that none of the money will go to help ANY Muslim child, then I will donate two dollars from my payment	6
Hey, before I forget, I did not tell you about the weather here.	3
Tell me a little about it, because I heard of it but don't know where the money goes?	0
What was life like for you growing up?	3
How do you raise donations?	3
Sounds like quite the worthy cause.	3
Definitely, I will donate my $0.30.	3
What do you think?	3
okay, it looks great.	3
Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..	8
Why yes I have.	3
Know I have not.	3
I agree.	3
I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	4
How much of a donation are you looking for from me?	3
How do I make the donation?	0
Sure, what amount is a smaller pledge?	3
respond with your mturk number and I'll donate .50	3
Huh, that's awesome.	3
What do you think?	3
I have a sister who is under eighteen.	3
That's awesome you have been to other countries. I don't mind helping at all.	3
You?	3
I'm sorry.	3
Ok, thank you so much for your help.	3
Will it help towards education?	0
I'm always about children.	3
great, yeah i think we can	3
Yes, I am okay with that.	3
Yes, absolutely.	3
Thanks, warmest regards from Alabama	3
I agree!	3
You are very welcome.	3
I am more interested in this.	3
Yes I donate to a few causes like breast cancer for women, autism awareness and March of dimes for children.	8
Hey hows it?	0
Heart breaking.	3
Especially animal organizations.	4
So nice job.	3
Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.	3
Do you donate/participate in any way to that charity?	4
True -- but how much money is currently being provided by US and NATO to help?	4
Hi, Yes I am	3
How many children do you estimate are benefited?	0
So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	3
What do they do?	3
I would like to donate $5 monthly.	3
Are there different tiers of donations?	0
I am fine how are you?	3
Ditto to you.	3
Well, I grew up in a wealthy house.	3
Additionally, I am just very skeptical of any organization that asks for money.	6
That was going to be my next question about if this charity helps kids in the US.	0
This should be the tenth response, I suspect we will be able to submit	3
where is the money going?	0
Thank you.	3
It's heartbreaking!	3
I will try to donate at least five dollars.	3
Does Save the children has the offices there?	3
I think it is very important to help children that are less fortunate.	3
People aren't likely to donate to charities that they know nothing about.	8
Where is this organization based?	0
Good to know.	3
I always like to help when I can.	3
They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	3
World Wildlife Fund: WWF, I like to support animals too if I can	8
Am Great, How about you?	3
you are very welcome!	3
Any organization who promotes rights for those who don't have the platform to speak up is a wonderful charity.	3
Yes, it is a worthy organization and I do believe that it helps in many substantial ways.	3
I doesn't cost much.	3
all children's using in the children's charity.. and all peoples join in the children's charity....	3
I am very interested in the welfare of the children especially in regard to food and education which I consider as very important for children	3
30 or more	3
I probably will.	3
Helping children and pets is one of the donations I enjoy making and helping at the same time.	3
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	3
Warm and rainy here.	3
What does Save the Children do?	0
How can i help?	3
Whats a more specific idea of what you do?	0
Are you planning to donate?	4
Yes I would.	3
115 USD to the charity	3
is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	0
i'm listening	3
That's nice of you.	3
I think this is all very interesting stuff.	3
How many total children has the charity helped since it began?	0
What is the one thing you would say to someone to encourage a donation?	0
What country receives the most aid?	0
I'll give .50 if you send are actually an mturk human.	3
really?	3
How you doin	3
What kind of stuff do they do to help the children?	0
I've been approached by people on the street.	3
How are you doing?	3
Thank you, you too.	3
i really love helping people	3
Sure thing.	3
Yes, I do.	3
oh yeah and how much would you help them	3
ready to fund.	3
Yes I have.	3
how much will you donate	3
I should do more to help.	3
As far as donating I have no problem donating to a greater cause as long as it benefits others short term and long term.	6
no, can you tell me more about it?	0
Are you involved with them at all?	3
It sounds like a good idea, but I often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when I donate I do it to causes that I know about.	8
I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	3
I can donate .10 of my mturk earnings.	3
Yeah lol	3
Have you ever made a donation to them?	3
At least my initial donation.	3
Ok-thanks-I will be waiting to hear from them	3
Have a good one!	3
Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	3
I wasn't aware that they did all of that.	3
Thanks, you too.	3
I will donate the $2 towards the Save the Children fund.	3
Yes, that was going to be my next question.	3
Sounds good, do I just go to the website to donate?	3
I will do that.	3
I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	6
Ok sounds cool	3
No I think they use most of their donations to actually help children.	3
They are our future exactly.	3
What type of agreement are they talking about?	3
I think I'll probably donate at the end of this conversation.	3
I do sometimes whe I have extra money	8
Have you presonally donated to them?	6
Do you donate to this organization?	0
as of now i am donating $1	3
that sounds great.	3
if I would agree with that, and if my organ donated what problems would my body have?	5
How are you	3
I haven't!	3
What is it about?	0
How about you do you have a favorite charity?	3
sorry but not now.	9
Do you know if this is tax deductible?	3
I am how are you doing?	3
I will donate all of $2 then :)	3
Yes.	3
That is a good charity it makes me happy to donate	3
The instructions weren't super clear on my end.	3
What are the amounts I can pick from?	3
I would like to donate $0	9
Similiar, I only donate when I have the money to spare.	3
That sounds like a great cause.	3
I have heard of that organization.	3
I am well, how are you?	3
how does the operation afford staff?	0
I think I'm ok.	9
Hello!	3
And to help children and animals as much as we can.	3
I am not saying that world charities are not needed but I rather give to local charities.	8
Great, I'm glad we're helping a little.	3
That sounds like a great idea!	3
Ok that sounds easy enough.	3
What is Save the Children about?	0
These are good things to donate for, but I still don't know exactly how my, or anyone's donations are used directly.	0
education?	3
With the commitment I made to the shelter, I would not donate at this time.	9
I can imagine!	3
at the moment i would have to say 0 because i don't know to much about the charity...sorry	4
Like mentioned I'm willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cents.	3
So do I.	3
I'm not sure, what do they do for children?	0
Yeah, that sounds great. I love donating to charity. I think it is important to help those less fortunate.	3
Can you give me their website, so I can look into them?	0
Ok i'll check it out.	3
it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.	3
I think I would rather donate to a childrens charity that takes care of American children.	3
Same to you!	3
I have seen information about this organization before	3
that is a good approach, i have been doing some research on charities	3
I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered.	3
Sure.	3
I do have a big family, I enjoy it at times, other times I don't	3
Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	3
I'm currently receiving food stamps so i don't buy candy and unnecessary stuff.	5
Education is must for everyone in the world.	3
sounds like a good charity.	3
That sounds important.	3
>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.	3
Perhaps a link to an organization or other agency that rates major charities would be more helpful.	6
Are you certain that the money will be used the right way?	6
Tell me more	3
How much is the average donation	3
Darn really gonna make me miss out on that bad of chips huh?...lol how about $1.15 and you have yourself a deal...	7
They seem to be.	3
Hello, yes I am willing to donate my payment from this task for the Save the Children charity	3
Thank you for your kind words.	3
I agree, this is a good cause.	3
That is a solid informational link, including a full board of trustees to look into.	3
No thank you for the work that you do	3
Is it reputable?	6
its my pleasure	3
Thank you for the information you provided.	3
I am good.	3
I was donate the amount of 10 cents......	3
Thank you for your time, and for the opportunity.	3
Will you donate the same amount back to me?	3
$5.00 i would donate	3
No problem have a good night	3
I still do not want to make a donation from this money.	9
We will donate today.	3
Mostly into hiking these days - how about you?	3
Gotcha!	3
More money but I enjoy giving the time	3
How much of a donation would one have to make to feed a family for a week?	3
I think I might donate mine too!	2
Do you have any info on this children's charity we're supposed to talk about?	0
What about You ?	3
Without the funding, it would not be able to continue and without volunteers, no one can do the actual work.	3
Yes I have.	3
give me some reasons i should donate	0
i got it.	3
Thanks, that is awesome	3
very good to do	3
That is good to hear.	3
Okay, where are the major areas you serve?	0
my life is going good.	3
Seems like a great cause!	3
How are you doing?	3
Would I find additional information about this charity in GuideStar?	0
I would like to donate $0.30 today.	3
i also usually focus that	3
I'm glad and happy to help!	3
Do you know what percentage of donations goes directly to programs (as opposed to overhead costs, salaries, and expenses)?	0
I would be fine with that.	3
It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	5
Is that correct?	3
Oh that's great!!	3
Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	3
Horrible, I know.....	3
I donate to charities often and can lose track of what I donate to.	3
So I like to donate $5 to the cause	3
It's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.	3
What does the charity do/what are my funds going to be used for?	0
I will are you going to help	3
i have in the past, good cause	3
Children hold the future of the world.	3
What are their goals?	0
I would definitely donate because I often donate to charities	3
Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	0
I think Disney World participates too.	3
Oh my!	3
In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	3
Any amount of money can help.	3
Are there any charities that work in that area?	0
I also ive to bakc to school drives and food pantries	8
Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	3
I think there are a lot of safeguards in organizations like this one that is set up to prevent such a thing.	3
Sure I will donate 30%.	3
I think charities would recieve a lot more if the country would go after the 1% to help	3
The website says that 86% of funds go to the cause.	3
There are no facts that prove that to be true.	6
People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.	4
Great - So how does the donation process work?	0
Thanks!	3
What do you know about this charity?	3
Sure.	3
I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	3
If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.	3
I wish they can help even more countries	3
Yes, I support a few causes that I personally believe in very much.	3
I agree with you.	3
So you think they do some actual good?	3
Sure, I would like to help.	3
I don't have the money right now to donate.	9
Actually, their own website may be a biased barometer of their giving.	6
what do they support exactly?	0
I can donate a dollar for now since I don't have much right but I feel obligated to at least donate something.	3
I donate a lot of money to battered wives and their children.	3
I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	7
You're very welcome.	3
ANything else I should know about this charity?	0
Ok done.	3
I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.	8
A couple of organizations claim to do that.	3
Ok I would like to donate the $20 a month but I would like to hook it up to a credit card that is automatically deducted	3
I'm certainly willing to listen.	3
Thank you very much forthat info you have been very helpful!	3
Excellent - how does it work	3
Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	3
How can someone help?	3
Bye	3
I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.	3
Is there a monetary goal set for the year?	0
actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly	9
Oh that is really nice.	3
I'll donate $0.05	3
Have you ever donated to them?	4

Oh, yes.	3
Well tell me a little bit more about the charity.	0

I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.	3
How does the sponsorship work?	0
No.	3
I don't have much. How about .25?	3

Well, thank you for wishing me well.	3
Is there anything else I need to do?	3
Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children.	3
okay, I might donate	3
I always prefer going through organizations I have researched to make sure they're reputable as well	8
I can do that	3
ok then i will donate half 15 cents	3
How do we end this task?	3
Wow, I can't even fathom feeling starved as a child or experiencing violence at a young age (outside of television/video games).	3
I understand that.	3
Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.	3
Yes, I think that would be accurate.	3
There is so much wasted in the world.	3
Hi there how are you?	3
I see, and do they provide medical help as well?	0
How do they help children in other parts of the world?	0
I haven't	3
I don't have much money at all.	7
How are you?	3
That is amazing.	3
That is so nice of you.	3
How old are they?	3
Is it a non profit?	0
Food?	0
I focus on kids and animals.	3
Alright, I will donate 25 cents.	3
Children in this world is very important because they are so vulnerable and they are the future of this world.	3
I think children need help.	3
It was pretty good, hot weather but still nice and yours?	3
I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.	3
how much?	3
How am I charged for donations?	0
But do not fully know.	0
I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.	3
Besides working in the morning, I plan to go out to a concert with a few friends on Saturday, so that should be fun.	3
Ok, well use your passion for the cause to speak nicely to people and educate them on why its important	3
I would like to donate $2 then.Thank you!	3
i need a little more information, if thats not too much to ask?	0
I work with Doctors Without Borders too, glad there are multiple players in the region to help!	8
But we can always try.	3
ok will check it out	1
How about you?	3
Sounds interesting but can you be a bit more specific?	3
Sure, I'm happy to donate half the payment for the HIT	3
To church, I return tithes and I also do the offerings	8
We're here to talk about a children's charity, is that right?	3
I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.	3
Well that's disappointing.	3
In the past few years I rarely have.	3
What forms of payments are accepted?/	0
Happy to help.	3
No, i haven't actually.	3
is this a religous charity?	0
Yes, But I remember what it gave me.	8
Great!	3
What do you mean you have gotten to save $100,You are saying it isn't a non profit?	0
I'm really passionate about children's rights no matter what background they are from.	3
I'd prefer a secure food donation that directly transports to the areas the children live in instead of handing over to government officials.	8
im not to sure yet	2
Yes, please go ahead and tell me	3
I think I have heard of it.	3
I have kids here that need help first	4
I was wondering the same thing.	3
Have a great week	3
I just hope the donation does help and do wish it could be more.	3
Welcome, thanks for talking	3
That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that.	3
That is nice.	3
How many children do they help annually?	0
I suppose even with the economy being as hard as it is, exchange rates are still good enough to make a real impact.	3
I have donated a few times to them too.	8
i'm not sure.	2
I am very happy to help	3
you too.	3
Okay.	3
But I"m always willing to help!	3
hi	3
I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid	3
yes, i do.	3
I am very curious to how the decision is made and what type of medical care they plan to deliver.	0
are they legit?	6
Have a great day!	3
I am not extremely familiar with them, but I have seen several ads for them.	3
Sure.	3
Would you whole heartedly donate?	6
I think it's the astronomical costs of healthcare.	3
i would love to donate for childrens' cause	3
to not be able to eat, or drink, and worry about being sick all the time	3
everyone should share 5$ or more?	3
Great!	3
Thanks.	3
Okay. I can donate $20.	3
I will donate all of my payment.	3
Great talking with you.	3
Iit is so imporantant for them	3
Absolutely.	3
I may do that.	2
Perfect.	3
I would be willing to donate the money from this task for sure.	3
of course or i wouldnt be online!	3
I know that it is a good organization and I support them.	3
Well, ok.	3
I accept that!	3
They're asking for $50, I was thinking more like $20.	3
So do I, I feel kind of guilty to being able to have all that and they are kids out there who don't have not a single one of all of those basic things	3
I think I would be interested in the child sponsorship.	8
Definitely a charity that I could stand behind and support.	3
Good choice	3
I actually have not.	3
Are any fund going to help the the children in Hawaii after the volcano and hurricane?	0
Children and Animals are the most precious of God's creations.	3
Are you familiar with it?	0
Hello, how are you today?	3
Established 1919	3
As I recall, for save the children, they were given a bad reputation back in the '90s due to their excessive spending on administration costs vs. program expenditures.	6
Yes, I just want to make sure that you read properly that I'm giving 0.1 not 0.01.	3
yes i have.	3
85 cents to 1.35 around here	3
yes i would	3
Yes somewhat.	3
Is there a website for this charity?	0
anything helps and It would make me feel better to know that I tried even if it not a big amount, I will donate what I can and continue.	3
How long have you been doing that?	3
it says a child's charity.	3
I have donated a couple of times; like for the St Jude's Hospital, red nose day and March of Dimes.	8
OH, yeah food please.	3
So tell me about this charity.	0
I'm not donating to your children's charity.	9
I live in the US and volunteer all of the time for childrens charities.	8
5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	3
They do an awesome labor	3
You have more power than you realize.	3
I am actually not sure.	3
all of it seems a little steep!	3
You're making this take far too long!.	5
Yes, I feel like if anything could use more funding, it should be children who need extra assistance.	3
I would like more information to be sent to me so I could look into it	2
I'm always so skeptical of charities to be honest.	8
Sure.I would be glad to. How much money do you think I should give?	0
I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?	0
I know!	3
What would donating like that help inform me on the charity?	3
So how did you decide what was right for you?	3
So what are the amounts for donation accepted?	3
Do they need clothes as well?	0
i have heard about it.	3
You must be so releived.	3
I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.	3
So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	3
yes, fifteen cents	3
We must help the children to give education.	3
I am excited to know we can help out a children's charity.	3
i can donate 5 if you truly are donating 5.	3
I always like to give a small donation of some kind and always believe that others should also.	3
No I didn't know that.	3
What is your favorite childrens charity	3
how they managing in 120 countries?	0
Which charity would that be?	3
So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!	0
No, I can't say I have.	3
I would think so?	3
yes.i am sure you can do more.there might be things you can cut from your budget	3
I wish I could do something to help.	3
I am hoping that things will change soon.	3
Go ahead and tell me how can I help	3
I would consider a smaller portion.	3
that sounds good	3
Thanks I would appreciate your help.	3
Through internet ads?	0
Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	0
That sounds great, What countries do they help children in?	0
Generous?	3
You're welcome!	3
I haven't.	3
Do they find family's for the children or are they running a orphanage?	0
Can you tell me more?	3
I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	3
Oh wow, so I could just go ahead and do like $25 million?	0
:)I like that it's non-governmental.	3
So are we agreeing to send $5 to save the children?	3
I almost never donate.	8
I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	3
Does it have commercials on tv?	0
Yes, I would like to hear more.	3
I agree all the way that they are the best creations of all.	3
How do they help the children?	0
That\'s the only reason I\'m still here.	3
Hey there how is it going?	3
ok great im in	3
is 20 dollars okay?	3
I typically give to them.	8
Yes that is correct	3
I totally agree.	3
i was just looking for a charity to donate to	3
goodnight!	3
Tha k you for my awareness	3
Hi there, how's it going?	3
I am interested in donating most of my task payment.	3
What do you think is the best solution or way to help for the average person like you or Me to render aid?	3
Where is the charity based out of?	0
Hi!	3
Do you have any personal connection with that charity?	3
Such as?	0
Okay.	3
How do we know that our donation is reaching those in need?	6
I was wondering that.	3
I thinkit's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.	3
Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	3
really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	0
i know i would like to help them with 5 dollars	3
then unfortunately, i cannot give any money	9
Thanks.	3
I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.	6
I'm guessing a lot more than me.	7
I still haven't decided for sure though.	2
I don't want to donate a dollar, but would consider donating something less.	3
I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	3
Yea...It was feel good...what's about you...?	3
I'd like to donate 5 dollar	3
Have you made a donation to this organization before?	3
It is the least I can do for him.	3
Suggestions on a donation amount?	3
I just feel that if they help a few children get a better childhood then it is worth it.	3
I will definitely check it out	1
That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	0
i'm happy with that.	3
Hello	3
To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	7
Same to you!	3
I'm looking it up right now.	3
I think so, it sounds familiar.	3
Is that the organization that is helping single parents obtain support from absent parents?	0
I am just very concerned for the children.	3
I work with children more in an "urban" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.	8
Well being that im kind of a poor person myself im kind of in the same boat as the children lol.	7
I always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child.	3
what was the procedure	3
I have a very rudimentary understanding.	3
For today I would like to donate $.30	3
I saw that they have pretty reasonable overhead fees, but the salary for the CEO was very high.	6
Really?	3
Yes, surely there is a good charity that can help children.	3
ok please do	3
In my personal life I do pay attention to all the details and the reviews of charities.	3
I'm not sure if I'm donating to you or if you're donating to me.	3
I tend to make donations to a emergency children's shelter.	8
There are ways to make a difference for sure.	3
Not only in the USA, but around the world.	3
doing fine, what about you	3
Did they provide housing for kids that went against their culture beliefs?	0
bye now.	3
what is save the children	0
I have heard of them, but have not looked into what they do.	3
Do you have any specific country in mind?	3
That is awesome.	3
That's terrible.	3
They sometimes don't put the money that is donated into the right projects.	6
That serves a purpose too!	3
It sounds like a meaningful charity.	3
No, I do not have kids.	3
How much you ready to pay for children?	3
Hi...	3
Yes I believe I will donate.	1
I am not surprised to hear that at all.	3
Do you know where I can go to donate?	3
I like the fact that it's an international organization.	3
Though MTurk they should raise quite a bit.	3
It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	3
If I donate, what do I get in return?	3
Yes before yes	3
I've seen a lot of commercials about them, but never did a lot of research about them.	3
Do you know how someone can get involved?	0
Oh my gosh.	3
I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them.	3
very good and you	3
I do the same for World Vision.	3
So if this just for children in America?	0
At least a portion of it.	3
It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world.	3
No I am not, but like I said.	3
It doesn't take much sacrifice to think of small ways to help!	3
I like to learn about an array of different things.	3
it would help to know what childrens charity as well with some information about it.	0
Good morning, how are you doing?	3
Yeah, I just looked it up.	3
Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	3
I'm great, how are you?	3
Are you thinking of a one time donation?	3
Fine and you?	3
no this one time is good, thanks	3
at least I try.	3
My small change won't do a thing for those kids.	5
But private donations certainly help.	3
Do nothing about what?	0
Oh really?	3
yes you can	3
The money would at least go to a good cause.	3
To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.	3
That's so important.	3
I do what I can to give back.	3
Glad to know it will go to a child in need.	3
I will look in to donating my time locally, thank you!	1
That is impossible at this time.	9
yes i would like to	3
I don't usually donate to charities.	3
What does it help the children with?	0
save th Children help kids in need around the world	3
How about you?	3
I am born and raised in Florida	3
That sounds really great.	3
I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	6
I could even go for the whole $.30 if you want.	3
I am mostly aware yes.	3
Same.	3
I totally agree, I think if you can, you should help others in need	3
Ok that is good to know.	3
I have been following politics and things are going crazy.	3
ok I support that	3
how much of the donation would actually go to the kids>	0
I used to donate to them.	6
Doing good.	3
Thank you.	3
thank you.	3
You never know though.	6
That would be real low on my list of priorities.	7
I could do that.	3
Thank you for telling me about this charity	3
Hurricane season is upon us, so I'm keeping a really close eye on that.	3
What is the name of the organization?	3
The organization sounds like a good one.	3
Doing Good.	3
I'm glad a charity like that exists internationally.	3
I like to donate 50 dollars.	3
Thank you "PERSON_1"	3
That's a big plus for me.	3
Okay.	3
Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.	6
hello how are oyu	3
From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.	3
Yes I am,	3
My life is awesome and your?	3
Oh, that's great!	3
How would you go about donating to this cause?	6
yes of course!	3
I wish I could do more.	3
What are your feelings?	3
Yes I have heard of them.	3
I might go back to the website to learn more.	2
Sure, go ahead	3
Good thanks!	3
That's actually quite reasonable!	3
Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	3
I didn't really do that much last week, but it was still relaxing.	3
Thanks for your time too.	3
Glad you took your time.	3
How much of the donation will actually be used to help the children?	0
Is this donation a one-time thing?	0
I don't like to donate to for profit businesses.	6
I really like how groups of people come together to make up these organizations, it so nice to see them helping people, in this case children.	3
Wow, that is so good to hear.	3
What do you need me to do?	3
Finnnnnne take the $1.25.	3
What do you think of children's charities?	3
no, can't say I've been	3
Good to know.	3
it's going good so far this morning for me.	3
What types of things are being done to help the children in Syria?	0
What about you?	3
How are you doing today?	3
To save the children where?	0
Amounts don't matter to me.	3
I would like to give 100% of the task payment.	3
Thanks for telling me about it.	3
how do we do that	3
Most of all save the children is a trustworthy organization which I trust to put my donations in with.	3
Should this HIT not be ending, I think it has had more than 10 rounds?	3
I am doing good and you?	3
I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.	7
yes .	3
I know more or less how it works and my goals are, but what do you know	0
I feel like a lot of charities squander the money and don't actually use all the donations for what is promised.	6
I can donate $0.50.	3
I just went there.	3
A one time donation would be best.	8
I'm kinda broke at the moment, though.	7
Are they a non profit organization?	0
Yes I will donate	3
How do I do that?	3
Right, nice chatting with you.	3
How do you feel about animal charities?	4
Anything that helps children succeed is definitely a great cause	3
It was great chatting with you.	3
That makes me feel much better.	3
If a charity is doing good work to feed the hungry, I will give what I have to spare.	3
this is true.	3
That sounds like a good organization.	3
I do want to help in anyway that I can.	3
I think so, it said we need to get to 10 turns of the conversation each, this is my 8th lol	3
No thank you	9
I DO	3
Hopefully we can move on soon to get back to other tasks.	3
Also I want to verify that this organization is most trusting.	3
I might want to volunteer too.	3
Yea...I am also feel bad that incident...	3
I guess that is true.	3
Do you mean in the USA?	3
oh ok then $50	3
Tlk to the people of that country.	4
Yeah, I donate here and there.	3
okey.	3
Yes.	3
OK. Glad that we came to an agreement.	3
Unfortunately I am having some money troubles right now so it's a little hard for me to promise any significant amount of money at the moment.	7
I would need to know more about the charity first.	2
If I have two very beautiful children that are my life, maybe that's why I'm very attentive to things like this of this magnitude	3
That sounds really cool.	3
Is the charity international?	0
I would consider it.	3
Yes, very often	3
Yes i believe it most DEFINETLY will make a big impact on others lives and its amazing to see such kind hearted people like yourself do so.	3
Like March of Dimes and the Salvation Army	3
SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.	3
Maybe.	2
Just need to investigate them a little more.	2
I think money that goes to kids is a super important cause.	3
I also found out that 86% of donations goes to services and only 5% goes to management.	3
What exactly would that 30 cents be used for and how would it help?	0
Or do you donate to other ones also?	4
well maybe you could donate to my child.	4
Glad to help.	3
They work in 120 countries already	3
How about you?	3
Im very good how are you doing today?	3
Of course im hear to listen .	3
I'll give 0.1 today	3
I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity.	8
Thank you so much.	3
I would consider donating $0.50.	3
It looks like they do great work.	3
Hi!	3
I am doing good.	3
Yes, I would donate some of my payment to help save children.	3
I have made donations in the past, but our money is bit tight since I'm a stay-at-home mom right now.	7
Thats good to hear.	3
That would be fine.	3
Interesting.	3
Okay that is nice and simple.	3
I'm alright and you?	3
I guess so.	3
Of course, its a great organization to support	3
I think it's very important to donate to charities.	3
I think our must move cautiously to deal with this country.	3
How much should we donate?	3
It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity.	3
oh ok I'm sorry I have read wrong, if I would be willing to donate with pleasure is a good cause	3
What would benefit me towards donating my $2 to the Save the Children fund?	3
in my church we help people no matter their age, but children are special for us	3
Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	3
Hi how are you doing today?	3
What about this charity.	3
I always like to know how the donations are spent.	6
I would certainly be willing to donate then	3
I will definitely do that.	3
That sounds like a good percentage and Im glad it will give me a tax break as well.	3
I am good.	3
I would really like to help.	3
What are my options for donation?	3
I think it's a scam	6
I am sure but I just am not able at this time	7
Wow, that is a staggering amount.	3
I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.	3
where do you came from?	3
I have a needy child of my own, and know how desperate that can make you feel.	7
if I define what makes me happy in life is to look and my beloved happy man	3
Yeah, I am thinking about donating half of my payment.	3
Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?	3
Hmm, I would like to, but I'm having some financial trouble at the moment.	7
Yes, it sounds like a good charity.	3
thank you for the information, I think I am ready to donate	3
what exactly does the charity do for children?	0
Does it come from our reward/bonuses?	3
What kind of supplies does my donation provide	0
I don't have a lot to work with either.	8
Why should I donate to this one in particular?	3
I feel that using money to but food directly in their cities is best.	8
How can I be sure that it will go where it's supposed to?	0
Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	3
Any amount I believe is good.	3
I would do anything to protect my son	3
I hope you're able to raise a lot of donations.	3
No, I can do it.	3
Always.	3
awesome!	3
war is like adults acting like children but worse because they know they're not showing regard to the people suffering	3
No its not.	3
How are you?	3
Wow, that definitely puts it in perspective!	3
The reason I ask is because I have cared for abused and neglected children and see the results and how it effects them for the rest of their lives.	3
I'm well, thanks	3
If someone believes they can take advantage of your ignorance, a lot of times, they will.	3
Yes, I have.	3
I would if I could.	3
I don't think so, what do they support?	0
Ethical charities do.	6
I would like to donate money to a charity to help this cause	3
Donating part of a purchase is such an easy way for a large amount of people to donate money.	3
What about you?	3
A small part maybe.	2
Do you know if the donations that we are making are tax deductible?	3
How much do you donate?	4
No, I have not.	3
Awesome!	3
Agreed.	3
I actually really need the money that I am making from this hit, so I would only like to donate 20 cents	7
I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate.	8
I usually donate to animal charities.	8
I do agree 100%How would I go about finding this charity?	3
good	3
Thanks very much, nice speaking to you.	3
You have no facts to back that up.	5
I'm good...what are we to discuss?	3
I'm often skeptical of big charities like that.	6
I will just go ahead and do the $20.	3
Oh that's great.	3
More as where are the majority of the fund headed towards right now/	0
Complete surveys.	3
anything else?	3
I look forward to working with Save the Children	3
I have no idea, maybe after we have 10 chat turns each	3
Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	1
ok, i also read we have to communicate atleast 10 times for the chat to end	3
i'd donate more but i don't have much myself	7
I will donate within 3 months	1
I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	3
Yea..It's nice too hear....	3
OK thanks.	3
Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here.	3
Ok, you too.	3
Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything.	3
What does the money go towards if I donate?	0
Okay, if you don	3
There is a good time and place for vaccines.	3
How would I know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity	6
I also take in children that would other wise go without.	3
Not Today but surely ASAP	1
good thanks.What about you?	3
It is hard to watch and not reach out to help a child.	3
That would defintely interest me.	3
Okay, what are my options?	3
Oh yes, I have heard that they do very important work!	3
I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities.	3
They are the weak ones in my eyes.	3
I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.	8
How does that work?	3
There is quite a bit of training and background checks, but it's worth it!	3
It's not easy for me to give anything and no charity has ever helped me.	7
how long has STC been around?	0
It's hard to ensure the money goes to the actual children tho	6
100$ donate for group	3
You're right, it is very important.	3
I may donate something!!	3
I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities.	3
How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.	3
Hi, I'm in Hawaii!	3
Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?	6
Is it an international charity, or exclusive to the US or another country?	0
Its so nice to see more poeple who care about them	3
Yes I will give my earnings to the Save the Children charity.	3
I'm good!	3
That sounds great.	3
So it looks like the money goes toward health and education?	0
It is very scary to think about.	3
How many children do they serve each year and how much of a donation are you talking about?	0
Okay I'll put it in my quarter if you put in yours and have an awesome day!	3
As a current nursing student, my goal is to become a neonatal nurse or pediatric nurse.	3
Have they raised a lot so far?	3
What is my payment?	3
Take care.	3
Oh, that sounds like a really good charity to donate to!	3
A little bit but not much.	3
Yes, I am thinking of donating to a childrens charity and I can now consider Save The Children.	3
Yeah I am interested to hear more.	3
Could you please tell me more about this charity?	0
Where are you from?	3
Yes I have, but I don't know a lot about it.	3
I woiwo be willing to donate $2	3
Because I like children	3
no its ok i just like children because they need help	3
I don't have a lot of income to donate to charity :(	7
Ok.	3
Great.	3
no i haven't	3
you were in military?	3
I will donate 10 cents of my 30 cent payment.	3
When it isn't available, I think it's important to provide for them if we can.	3
There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.	5
So we are supposed to chat about a children's charity.	3
I hope lots of people donate to you.	3
I'll agree to pay half.	3
I guess so	3
ok what can i help with that	3
Thanks you too	3
What do they do exactly?	0
No I havent.	3
Wow, that's amazing.	3
I was born in USSR and we had very limited resources.	7
I think that you convinced me.	3
I'll do $20.	3
I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	3
Yes I would.	3
Hang on though.	3
I only like to donate to reputable organizations, I am familiar with save the children, they often advertise.	8
I know that it is a charity.	3
I would like to donate.	3
Thank for answering my questions.	3
I feel that 20 cents is adequate for the donation.	3
tell me more?	3
Not without knowing the exact organization	8
I would choose 0 in this instance	3
It is very kind of you.Please spread the word on your family and friends	3
I agree!	3
Thanks so much.	3
I bet it's especially good around Christmas when people are in the spirit of giving.	3
i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	3
Awesome.	3
Imagine not have clean water to drink.	3
What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	0
That's fine with me.	3
Yes, I absolutely would.	3
Especially those who are very wealthy themselves and don't care to make a difference	3
Yes, few dollars can save a child or can help a family to survive for a month.	3
You are a wonderful person.	3
ok nice.	3
Those children need your help.	3
yes sounds great.	3
When making the donation, what are the steps?	3
Yes.	3
okey.	3
Is America helping?	0
how much do you give	3
Yes- I've donated to a similar charity before but it was based on supporting kids education	3
True, especially if you take part in donating.	3
At least you're doing some good, though.	3
Hot, and well, I think the sun is coming around	3
Yeah, I have used Gospel for Asia in the past	8
Its all good bud.	3
Really sad situation.	3
$0.25 is a good amount	3
How much do you want to donate?	3
Tha k you so much for the infkrmation	3
Helping people makes people feel good	3
That's a thought.	3
Well that sounds just great to me!	3
yes i am very interested!	3
Yes i didnt think that it would be this easy thats amazing	3
What's it spent on?	0
ty..i will contact and agree to start off with 10$ per month	1
Go right ahead.	3
Do you know what Save the Children's reputation is for actually using the money it collects to help children versus for fundraising and administrative salaries?	6
hopefully many more people help out so that they can get food and medicine	3
Awesome.	3
Pushiness does not make for a good salesperson.	3
yes they will	3
Have you heard any break thought about this charity?	0
Children should be our top priority all across the world.	3
Why are you passionate about this particular one?	3
they are hungry and injured and also short	7
That seems reasonable.	3
Hi!	3
Aww, that would be so considerate of them!	3
how much do you think i should donate	0
no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	3
Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	0
Do you know anything about how they are helping the children?	0
That is wonderful, whenever there are charity events or donations being taken.	3
What do you do for a living?	3
good morning too and am also same as your location	3
I would like to donate $.50	3
Are you planning to donate today?	3
That's great!	3
Children really need people to help them.	3
nice to meet you, do you know any good children's charities	3
Really?	3
what donations are we talking about?	3
I hope it is not too severe.	3
I like to donate.	3
Hello.	3
That's wonderful!	3
how do you have experience with them?	3
Is that something that you personally do?	3
How are you today?	3
Save the children	8
This reminds me of Ronald McDonald as well	3
I spend about 5 dollars a day, you?	3
I do not understand.	3
have you?	3
Okay great, is there parking for the venue or should i get a taxi there?	3
Ok, well thank you for your time and telling me about this wonderful organization.	3
Ok if you need means you take that amount.	3
Does the IRS recognize it as a nonprofit?	0
yes I confirm .50	3
What Children's charity would you like to donate money to?	3
I have given a few extra cents sometimes at the checkout in grocery stores.	8
That makes sense.	3
Would you prefer to donate clothes, food, money, or something else?	3
That would be fine with me.	3
i'm sure you love children, right?	3
I just do not have the funds available.	9
Tell me more.	3
How did the visit go?	3
I can donate the .30 base payment but I am still very curious on donating outside the HIT.	3
I can't afford much.	7
Oh that is really a great idea.	3
I would be willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cent payment to help save children.	3
I do.	3
I mean, a penny is nothing in the grand scheme of things.	3
Lots of celebrities get involved.	3
I do know save the children.	3
I think we each have to exchange 10 messages before I can do that	3
Yeah - I try to donate once a month or so	8
I do think it is a good cause.	3
whetehr i acn trust this charity?	6
I would have donate a smaller amount.	3
How are you	3
Yes I am aware of that charity	3
Yes, I would be willing to donate a small portion as well.	3
shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	7
Oh really?	3
Is there a website where i can donate?	0
Exactly, in today\'s world one must be weary of scammers.	6
I would possibly be interested in that.	3
You're right!	3
Go ahead	3
Words are just words sometimes.	6
hows $0.50 sound?	3
I have!	3
The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	3
thats true to help them	3
You too.	3
children must be educated i didn\'t heard about"save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	3
I'd like to donate $0.50	3
What is in it for you if I donate?	3
terrible thing that happens	3
Do you only work in the US?	0
Sounds like they really help education wise.	3
I would definitely like to make a donation!	3
How long has this group been in operation?	0
But it's been mostly local church related activities.	3
I will donate $100 to them today.	3
I haven't heard of this one?	3
That is good information.	3
I think they are important; and there are several focusing on distinct issues.	3
I agree.	3
Maybe we will get a dollar.	3
I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	3
of course i could do so from my paypal	3
Sure!	3
How did you find the charity?	3
I\'m not going to donate to some generic "Save the Children" charity with no information.	9
i will donate now 5 dl	3
That is very impressive.	3
Ive had a few of the charity HITs.	8
Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	3
Thank you. You too	3
oh that sounds good..how do they help	0
I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.	3
Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	3
If everyone puts in there fair share then save the children would be even bigger, could you imagine how much children could be saved or help,or both	3
I won't be donating as part of this survey.	9
I appreciate you informing about this but i'll be donsting at a later time	1
Good morning!	3
Is it world wide.	0
a little, what do they do?	0
How long has this charity been around?	0
but this group sounds great!	3
it depends.	3
such an important job!	3
Like most people who do mTurk, I do really need the money to pay my bills.	7
Do I get updates on a specific child if I donate monthly?	0
However I will donate later.	1
so what is this about anyway?	3
Yes, they need all the help they can get there after the missiles and chemical attacks	3
Its extremely sad.	3
Yes, I'm not sure either, but it just kills me to know there are ids suffering.	3
haha.	3
We have a school here in my small town for children from broken homes.	8
it is great things to do	3
I like the sound of their work, but I'm always suspicious about how much of a donation reaches the people in need.	3
I think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	3
its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	3
I understand that we will both be donating.	3
That sounds fantastic!	3
Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	3
I'd love to visit one of their facilities.	3
Well I'm sure there is always more that can be done.	3
Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	3
I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.	8
I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	3
No, I didn't see anything.	3
That is super important work, obviously.	3
Thank you!	3
yes 0.15 is correcr	3
Thank you for telling me about this organization	3
I would like to donate but I am not a huge fan or donating just for promotion?	2
I do like but have not volunteered them, but if i get a chance i try to do	3
no problem.	3
I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.	6
what is the donation for?	3
I am considering a donation.	2
Yes, a few times before	3
So why do they deserve my money as opposed to other charities like St Judes or the Red Cross>	8
Again, you're only giving me an opinion.	5
As a parent you want to do all you can for them.	3
I've lived for 76 years and have only experienced two reasonably good presidents.	5
I think it would be roughly $1.20.	3
I think it is a genuine organization who uses it's fundraising donations in the right way.	3
As of right now i honestly would but i dont have the funds for it if their are other ways im albe to get others to donate as well and help out in any way possible i will be more then willing to do so..	8
you sound very passionate about this subject.	3
I happily did.	3
I am interested in it.	3
I'd like to know what specific ethnicity are we supporting	0
Why the aggressive tone of me "donating or not"?	3
I don't know if I'd necessarily feel comfortable donating.	2
However, I think I'll opt for a one time 0.05 donation instead.	3
But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most	3
yes it is.	3
It sounds like a great charity.	3
God bless and good morning.	3
Are they well rated by the watchdog groups that keep an eye on non-profits?	0
They look really good.	3
I'm sorry to hear about your nephew?	3
Hello.	3
no	3
Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food.	3
Hello	3
I took a little time to look up information on the organization, but didn't see that.	3
No I would not	9
How can I donate?	3
please ur nice name?	3
Are you talking about around the world or in the states?	0
I have thought about it in the past.	3
Or is it just save the children?	3
I'm going to tell more people about the charity	3
I bet the kids there are in need.	3
If I have anything it will go to homeless shelters, food pantries and environmental causes.	8
Hi.	3
I wanted to buy clothes for myself today, but I will give them some kind of charity online search, full $ 100	1
How are you?	3
No need to share more information	3
I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.	3
It is been enlightning!	3
Yes, for sure.	3
IT looks really good and professional.	3
Wow thats way more than I would have thought.	3
for sure we must do something, but many people are blind, they see just the green of the money, they dont interact with people to see whats their problems are, i really want to help go in africa or some place but i dont know how i can go with a organization.	4
I'm still not sure.	2
It's so important that there is a organization looking out for children.	3
If I make donations now, they are in-kind donations rather than monetary donations.	8
I wanted to help and want to help with a donation	3
I would like to donate $0.	9
I am fine, thanks!	3
Any organization that helps kids is one worth supporting, either with my own time or with money.	3
WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	3
as per today's earning is very little I would like to donate 1	3
I may want to volunteer my time as well instead of just money.	3
Are you interested?	3
I will copy and save the website address.	3
Are there any other charities I can donate to?	3
that sounds great.	3
Sure	3
Sounds good.	3
I'm doing well.	3
THat sounds good, deal	3
wow that sounds like a problem	3
I would possibly be interested!	3
I have not made a donation recently.	3
You sure can	3
Half the payment - One whole dollar	3
powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	4
You are so welcome.	3
They seem to be doing a good job.	3
Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.	3
I am on a very tight budget.	7
Could you provide me with the link	0
Well that seems better than some I have read about.	3
I would like to donate $10 right now.	3
Yeah totally agreed.	3
Ok, I will consider doing that.	2
What countries do they provide service to?	0
What do they do?	0
Awesome.	3
so i donate that charity	3
Where does the other 10 cents go then?...and I guess it's a good thing I decided to give them that dollar then =)	6
How are you doing?	3
I did not know that	3
It makes me very sad!	3
The work you do is important.	3
I always like to see some report first.	6
That is cool that you lived in three different states.	3
I'm so gonna support it!	3
Actually I like these kind of HITs.	3
Looking forward chatting with you too.	3
Do they help our children in the US as well?	0
What do you think?	3
I'm in a tough financial situation right now so i really need money but i would like to donate.	7
Will I be getting any sort of reward as well?	0
I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support.	0
It sucks that not all people and children have the comfort of having a stable place to stay or the comfort of knowing they are able to eat.	3
I am okay.	3
Unfortunately, I cant do that.	9
The Children's Hope Alliance in our town provides housing and schooling for children.	8
So do I provide my email to you?	3
I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.	3
Fine...what about you..?	3
No I am not.	3
That's nice.	3
This sounds really good!	3
Very good.	3
Thinking about starving children makes me so sad.	3
Do you know what kind of services they will provide with the money?	0
I can donate 10 dollars.	3
I find it very fulfilling to give back	3
Have you ever donated to a children's charity?	3
i mostly deal with friend and other persons	3
I worry that my money won't actually go to the children, that it'll just be paying for someone's job at the charity.	6
I wish I could do more.	3
What amount would help out?	3
I need to think about it.	1
How much of a donation are you talking about?	3
What is the minimum dollar amount?	3
Ill donate $1	3
No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	3
That sounds like a very worthy cause.	3
how long have you been donating for?	4
I am good.	3
Are you going to donate too?	4
Well, I would prefer to hear more about the charity, their work and how much of their donations go to direct work with these children.	0
That's an honorable reason. :)	3
I have not.	3
St Jude's is another great organisation.	3
Maybe, I'm not sure.	3
Boy and girl.	3
That is good.	3
I would like to donate 10 cents from this task to Save the Children please.	3
Thank you.	3
I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though.	3
I can do $2.00!	3
OK that sounds reasonable.	3
I am not familiar with Save the Children	3
OK perfect!	3
That's the goal, for sure.	3
yes i sure will do donate.	3
Kuddos to them!	3
I think you are a wonderful person.	3
Very Well, How about you?	3
Hello, I am doing good, alright lets get started!	3
What developing companies?	0
Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	1
Is this okay?	3
I was wondering why you were talking about "save the hold ten" vs. "save the children."	5
Thank you!	3
hello	3
helping children without parents is the most altruistic thing we can do	3
yes i am live in us	3
I would be glad to make a $10 donation	3
What is the charity?	3
what are your children's age ?	3
is that even worth it?	3
I think we should donate at least 17 dollars but less than 19 dollars	3
Yes i will.	3
Hey, I am doing well	3
It was nice chatting with you too	3
Hey how's it going?	3
I would.	3
in which regions are the donations applied?	0
I have to question that they have provided only tents.	4
how much can i donate?	3
Enjoy they walk, I hope it isn't too hot like here.	3
I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.	6
I hope it wsn't a waste of your time.	3
We went out with family to eat and are just taking it easy and yourself?	3
cool, so what can i do	3
oh ok thats nice	3
that is true.	3
Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?	8
would donating one penny help	3
Glad I was in a position where I was able to help	3
Sure, let's do it.	3
I can't decide which onne.	3
I heard that, with some organizations, only 10% of the money goes to the recipient!	3
Great! Thanks so much and I'm just so happy to be able to donate	3
All I can afford is $5.00.	3
That's impressive.	3
A ten dollar donation sounds reasonable to me.	3
Nope, what do you recommend?	3
Yes everything counts, that's how it starts.	3
tell me more	0
It is so sad.	3
yes i have heard of it, it is very good what they are doing.	3
I have thought about it before.	3
I wonder sometimes how much of the actual money that gets donated goes to helping people and not into the pockets of those running the charity.	6
Good for you!	3
I hope so.	3
I will look at it in the future.	1
It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.	3
It hurts my heart when I see those children's charity commercials.	3
Let's do that then.	3
Absolutely!	3
Right, it will probably have to be 80% of my task payment then.	3
Yes I have.	3
It's important to give every child an opportunity to succeed.	3
I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	8
Wow!That's really great!	3
That sounds extremely awesome.	3
I completely agree!	3
I'd rather donate to Ronald McDonald - how much are you donating, though?	8
Have a great day	3
yes i have a child	3
I would be glad to.	3
i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	3
My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	5
Oh for sure.	3
No but I just copied the link and am going to look at it now.	3
Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	0
I would be willing to at least donate a portion of my earnings to help this charity.	3
Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	8
I wish I could give more, but I am broke	7
Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	3
so sad.	3
Yes, I also like what they do.	3
May your days be pleasant, as well.	3
I wonder how much their CEO makes for saving the children.	7
Like our animal shelter, a low income housing group, foster care organziations, etc	3
How much of a donation are you looking for?	3
No, I have not hear that	3
I have a passion for children.	3
What childrens charity is this?	3
you too.	3
How exactly does it support children in developing countries?	0
What about you?	3
Ronald McDonald House is the name I think.	3
We still have chat a bit more.	3
Yes that is very true.	3
I sponsor through World Vision.	8
I could definitely justify giving $20 to them.	3
That is awesome.	3
Great thanks, Im here to talk about the childrens charity.	3
No, I don't believe I have.	3
One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	3
Are you connected with the NGO yourself?	4
Why not Antartica?	5
Plus there are starving children right here in america	6
We have SO many places to go to for help	3
Sounds amazing.	3
Out of the earnings I earn from this survey I would probably donate at least half.	3
Yes its really appreciated	3
I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the moneyis going to where they say it will.	3
I believe it is- I've seen commericals for it on TV before....	3
Yeah, I can do that.	3
i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	3
Also, I have another question for you if you have a minute.	3
okay, that sounds good.	3
I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.	3
yeah I try to do that too.	3
Is this charity local?	0
And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university	8
Paypal is usually my choice.	3
It is a beautiful morning where I am at.	3
So I have much empathy for these children and their needs.	3
On the website?	3
That is good.	3
It is the least we can do.	3
I understand that.	3
I think that we take many things for granted such as running water, and always having food on the table.	3
oh i would donate money too even it 5 dollars	3
i would be willing to donate 0.2 $ , i know it is not what others aspect me to give.	3
do they help children in africa	0
No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me!	3
Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	3
Have you personally donated?	4
no i havent	3
Before I commit to a donation, can you tell me how much actually goes to the children and how much goes to the organization itself?	0
Yes.	3
Go for it.	3
Have you ever personally worked with them?	3
That's great!	3
How about you?	3
I'll check out that website later.	1
No, but I see the work being done everyday in my community..	8
Very true. $5 it is. At least we are giving something. Most people wouldn't.	4
It is sad.	3
Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	3
That makes sense.	3
Good how are you?	3
I have not.	3
OK yes I am aware of this organization	3
I'm sorry I'm just not able to at this time but thank you for telling me about this organization.	9
thank you,I just want to help this world and especially the children within it and save the children is doing that job	3
I knew it was a large number, which is one of the things I was thinking Save the Children could help with	0
What would motivate you to donate to a children's charity?	3
YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	3
That is what I like to hear!	3
oh wow ok how much do you suggest?	3
Do you have personal experience?	3
Important to make sure their basic needs are met too -- food, clothing and shelter	3
Yes I have	3
i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar	8
That's incredible.	3
That's good because hurricanes have devastating effects.	3
Do you donate through MTurk only?	3
Alright I will ask my co-workers	3
No problem!	3
That is great!	3
I'd like to see how the money is dispersed in the company	1
That is correct.	3
You definitely can...but not today.	1
That really wouldn't bother me at all.	8
I agree to 20	3
Send over rights?	3
I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	3
How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	0
Do you accept monthly donations of smaller amounts?	0
Then I will do it.	3
ok, got it.	3
You are welcome.	3
I will.	3
Many countries have absorbed many refugees and I am fairly certain that way more aid than tents has been provided.	4
Also to abused women.	3
No, I have not.	3
Yes, definitely.	3
Yes, I have donated a year before.	3
yes, I believe i have , is it for kids with Cancer?	0
I have no problem donating the entire $2, and I agree, every bit does help!	3
I may be interested.	3
Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	3
It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.	3
I will give .20	3
I wouldn't have the time off to do that.	3
Yes, I have.	3
That's really a great cause.	3
How can I help?	3
What about you?	3
i do not	3
That is amazing!!!	3
Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?	0
It is a big thing to do.	3
Ok, I will definitely help out.	3
All my kids love their security blankets.	3
What do you think I should donate?	3
I see, well, I'd love to do that then	3
Especially with children.	3
Oh that is interesting.	3
You.	3
What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses	0
I am already making a difference in many children lives.	8
No, there are other charities that do a much better job in my opinion that I already donate to, such as Compassion International and World Vision for international children's relief, and my local food shelter.	8
I think 0.50 cents is a perfect amount to donate.	3
Can you?	3
In America food is plentiful and we sometimes have to stop and reflect, that other countries aren't as fortunate as we are!	3
Possibly, do they have a website?	8
Americans pay more for poorer outcomes, compared to peer countries.	3
What do you have in mind?	3
I know a little bit.	3
$35,000,000,000.00	3
What is the website for Save the Children?	0
Me 2.	3
I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	4
I did not have to worry about those things.	3
good education and good health	3
I'll gladly give all of my payment.	3
Do you regularly try to help the organization yourself?	4
Have you ever sponsored a child?	4
Agreed.	3
Oh, ok.	3
What about controveries in 2009 regarding parents in Britain?	6
That sounds good.	3
you are welcome	3
I don't know I haven't found anyone good ones	6
very good today, just turking	3
Switching tasks all the time can be very difficult.	3
aw, really ?	3
How do they help children?	0
I live in new york	3
yes definitly i am donate in save the children	3
Am I able to communicate with the child?	3
Not really, please tell me anything!	0
If I donated to every cause I would be giving away a lot of money and I already lose 20% to taxes.	7
Are you familiar with it?	3
I donate a portion of my paychecks to feed the children. Do you have a favorite charity?	8
What specifically would you like to talk about?	3
Even they are not able to get good meal and got suffered from many malnutrition diseases.	3
same to you :)	3
You are welcome; anything for the children I say!	3
That would work best for me.	3
Good for them.	3
But I would like to be able $150 to this charity.	3
To make sure that they have all that they need, and more than I ever had.	3
How about you?	4
I could definitely do that.	3
I have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.	3
I want to donate everything	3
That's awesome!	3
I think about them so often.	3
How do i donate?	3
Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	3
Unfortunately, it is all I can afford at the moment.	3
yes I would be honored to.	3
Thats very sweet of you.	3
OF course, it will be great for all around, my daughter to see that she should do things like this out of kindness and for the children , thank you	3
that's great.	3
I can't afford a lot right now because I have other bills, but I could probably do $5 now with more next month.	3
It's definitely a motivator!	3
oh yeah, absolutely!!	3
It's really nice outside where I am so I am sitting outdoors.	3
Yeah, a few local charities.	3
What are your dogs names?	3
It's a charity, right?	3
That's very impressive, I am glad that I am donating this charity now that I know more about them.	3
yes I can.	3
That's wonderful!	3
I'll definitely check them out.	1
That's good of you to donate.	3
Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.	3
Yes, sometimes I feel a little guilty that I have it so easy.	3
Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	8
Would that help?	3
I used to tutor kids in my spare time in college.	3
I think that it is so important that the money goes to the children and not to salaries.	6
Do you donate to any on a regular base?	4
I see, you misspelled the charity at the beginning.	5
I had heard about the McDonald's charity and see the change box, but I did not know much about it until a customer told me his son used their services when i was getting food once	3
the operation has risks	5
I donated 1000 dollars to them.	8
But that's pretty cool what they do.	3
who own the charity	0
yes, I will do it	3
I am not sure	1
OK - what specifically were you thinking about?	3
Yes I would be willing to donate $1	3
THis has been a great hit.	3
$1.50 sounds good then.	3
Where does the other percentage of donations go?	0
I think it would really help them out	3
Like do they just supply food?	0
yes I do, because it is need.	3
Where is the charity located?	0
How much of donations go to the kids?	0
I am curious what we can do to help.	3
i have no award in the group.so i have like many children save in our life	3
It really upsets me	3
If only all kids were so lucky.	3
wow how awsome it will really make a difference and i'm so happy we can both help to make a difference (double high five )	3
Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation.	8
That's great of you!	3
I don't have any children but there are many children in my family.	3
However, every cent counts.	3
I agree.	3
I'll definitely go and make a donation today.	3
I can not believe how warm it is already.	3
Alright.	3
yes you can you can have my $0.30	3
Yes. Save the children is a very nice organization	3
I would be willing to donate a portion of my wages	3
Do you donate money?	3
Do I make a monthly donation?	0
I am sorry I am unable to help.	7
Hi, I'm great, how are you?	3
No.	3
I am not aware of that.	3
Hello!	3
It makes me scared for her and my nephews as well.	3
Am not Financially stable now, but i love to help such children soon	7
I'm doing very well thank you!	3
i will donate 0.10 today	3
Do you know when the charity began?	0
oh ok thats fine	3
That is absolutely terrible.	3
I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.	3
No I don't have any other questions.	3
Great!	3
Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	7
I hope you do as well!	3
we can see our happiness on other faces while helping for them	3
Thank you!	3
Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	4
then is there any think special about it	3
Yes it is good to try and help in any way possible	3
I am curious if I can state if money goes to children in this country though?	3
hmmm, let me think about it	2
How do you feel?	3
Great idea!!	3
I wish there was a long-term solution to these problems.	4
Yes.	3
Me too.	3
I'd be interested in donating to your cause	3
I think it's a great chairty.	3
i know it's not much, but wanted to do something.	3
I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	2
I know how hard it can be to be healthy, so I want to help kids get the treatments they need.	3
You can send me the information with the email you have on file for me. :)	3
I think they might even help in Hawaii with the recent floods, don't you think?	3
I will defiantly be donating at the first of September though.	1
I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.	8
For sure.	3
No.	3
oh, I didn't know that I just assumed if we reached an agreement before that they would let us advance.	3
yes, that would be great, I like to compare to see.	3
Do you have any more information about the organization that you could tell me?	0
Is it a global charity?	0
That way i know where my money is going.	3
It's only fair.	3
I can participate directly through volunteer hours and I can also actually visit the children that I help through my family's donations.	8
This HIT is a rip off, taking far too much time.	3
Tell me more info otherwise you can donate to the charities that I know do extraordinary work and spend most of their donations on the children	0
It was great chatting with you.	3
What have you heard people say or have seen online about the charity?	0
That really isn't an answer to the previous question, though	5
I wish they were way more specific in the instructions on both ends.	3
interesting, what do the ratings represent	5
I'm doing well, thanks!	3
in one occasion trip to Latin America and there the situation is very sad, many children live in the street without anyone	3
That's pretty awesome.	3
I'l do 20 cents	3
same here!	3
that's very sad.	3
Okay.	3
They actually have an office near me then.	3
Sure i would love to	3
I'm good, and you?	3
How about 15?	3
No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	3
Outstanding.	3
That sounds great!	3
Yes I do, you've really inspired me Tommy	3
i would donate some clothes and some toys for children	3
Do they have a donation tier level?	0
that's true.	3
No i will not until I do further research.	9
You can find it atURL	3
Is there anything else you can think of that we could do?	3
I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.	3
Have you donated to this organization?	4
I will absolutely look to donating something later, just because I have always wanted to anyways and now this so why not.	3
I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.	6
I've never heard of that one.	3
I really can't do much, but I'd be glad to put down a dollar	3
Have you heard of them?	3
Doyou volunteer any where?	3
what do i need to do now to help?	3
Do they help kids in the US?	0
No problem.	3
do you live in the states ?	3
Hello, I'm alright.	3
save the children sounds like an amazing organization.	3
Ugh that is rough..Nobody deserves that in this world	3
How do I make sure my money is being used for that purpose?	6
Ok i will donate some	3
however there are lots of kids in my ocuntry that need help first	4
That sounds interesting.	3
I have helped at soup kitchens before but that's my own extent	3
we have to walk early and late.	3
I've been working really hard to save every dollar that I can to make sure I can pay my bills.	7
There were periods in my childhood when money was very short and we had our telephone or power cut off, but I always had a safe place to live and food to eat.	3
I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.	3
what other organizations would you consider?	4
i donate sometimes.	3
Can I donate $30 a month?	3
Can't ever imagine hurting kids	3
They should probable do internet promotion.	3
okay im fine with that	3
Hello, same!	3
Yes, I agree.	3
What are the typical donations to the charity like?	0
How do you feel about donating to a children's charity?	4
I always try to donate anonymously.	3
I'm great!	3
I have not heard about it.	3
Hello.	3
Sounds good.	3
I appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.	3
Enjoy the rest of the day.	3
I'd be willing to donate $.05.	3
That's interesting and sounds good, right?	3
I'm not sure how much I'd be willing to donate.	1
Yeah I agree.	3
I would consider it.	3
Do you have any more information about it?	0
What kind of children's charities do you know about?	0
It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	3
how can i contact them	3
That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	3
i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	3
Great.	3
This is,URL??	0
There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.	6
go ahead :)	3
I'll certainly review it.	1
I'm sorry I meant $20	3
Is it a charity that you are interested in?	3
That is an incredible figure!!!	3
ok	3
Could you tell me more about the charity?	0
what is it abuot?	0
I will also tell others about this charity.	3
The exchange rate must be pretty good.	5
It was nice speaking with you! :)	3
Okay, that sounds reasonable	3
It sounds like it.	3
Any child that needs help deserves it.	3
yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause	3
I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	7
do you?	3
Sorry, no.	9
However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	3
that is so sad do you work for the foundation?	3
Yes, I know about Syria.	3
Sure is sad to see so many children in distress around the world.	3
Thank you for introducing me to another great charity that is trying to do good work.	3
Where can I go to send it?	0
What's their website address?	0
Children should be with their parents!!	3
What type of help do you provide to those poor families?	0
Most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	3
There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	3
What is their website?	0
Well, I already donae to other charities so I'm not sure.	8
Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.	8
How are you?	3
It was my pleasure	3
Oh, mine just says "children\'s charity" but does not mention any specifics.	3
It was nice chatting with you.	3
How does me saying I will donate fake money make a good impression for future hits.	3
I have seen a lot of commercials on TV for it.	3
Okay, please tell me about the charity.	0
I will donate 10 cents.	3
You too!	3
I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.	8
Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	0
I think I will donate to them today too.	3
Yes, But I donated about 0.20 cents.	3
How do i know if it's a legit organization	6
I glad we can help.	3
Iwork in an office setting as well, I guess we are to talk about childrens charity's.	3
Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	3
If so, how much do you give?	3
I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	1
I agree, Save the children foundation work with the children through out their lives to make sure they grow up in a safe environment and get a chance to succeed based on their website.	3
Let's both do .15 but split among Ronald McDonald and Save the Children!	8
Yes, I have	3
I suppose not.	3
He even made it through college.	3
support children in more development country?	0
They could use some of that money for school supplies.	3
Your work is appreciated	3
So after making a donation, I won't exactly see how the money I give will be used right?	3
That;s great!	3
I still know nothing about the charity and I\'m already a half hour into a 2 dollar HIT.	3
Do you?	3
I wish I could more but I am trying to pay my bills with what I make here.	7
That is awesome	3
There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket.	3
Ok.	3
I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.	7
You shouldtype the samething and if perhaps if you know anything about the charity, share it?	3
I hope you have a great day as well!	3
They sound like they are a legitimate organization.	3
Does this money that goes for donation stay here in the United States?	0
nope 1 is cool	3
they sound like a good charity to donate to	3
I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	6
I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.	3
I can afford $5.00	3
It does.	3
absolutely i will support them.	3
It feels good to make a difference if only for one child	3
That sounds like an amazing charity.	3
I do not only help the children but everybody who needs some help if this financial or moral help	8
So we should do that to make sure we and the charity get paid right?	3
Could you tell me more about this charity?	0
And you?	3
I think I could donate $5.00.	3
i would like to donate but i dont have a lot of money myself.	7
Nice!	3
Some don't give the money out like they are suppose to.	4
Alright I will donate.	3
great and you are you going to donate	3
They sound like an interesting charity.	3
Good, how are you?	3
Depending on the amountI will match your donation but ONLY if you answer the following question: How do you feel about the organizations work?	3
I think that's great!	3
Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	3
thank you.	3
Thank you for your time	3
Maybe I'll consider donating to them	2
Nope, mine doesn't maybe that was the point, to see if I would donate to just any charity. Still I always hope the money actually gets to them.	3
Sure I will donate 20 cents.	3
How are you?	3
That would be so sweet of them.	3
Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	0
How much money are you looking for?	3
I will look into it for sure and make a donation.	3
I have heard of Save the Children Fund.	3
Okay that sounds good but how much would a donation of that size be?	3
I think so.	3
That's amazing.	3
If did they amount was 0..	3
ok .60 firm this time	3
And you likewise to ask.	3
I also want to make sure my donations are not going into the pockets of money hungry CEO's.	6
One last question - are all members who help volunteer based?	0
Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	3
and where are you from?	3
I'll donate $0.50.	3
With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	8
I think i will make a donation of $2	3
What do they do?	0
Is it a well regulated agency?	0
I'm really glad to hear that.	3
Hi.	3
I don't believe they can actually do that haha	3
I could spread out donations.	3
do they take donations	6
I know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages.	6
yes i am are you?	3
Yeah, totally!	3
ok$1 it is	3
I would.	3
I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.	9
lol	3
this is a perfect charity organization , they do all kind of things to help others around the world.	3
since you are so into helping out kids	4
That is wonderful!	3
I'll donate $10	3
Yes, I've heard of it.	3
What countries have they been able to help?	0
Yes, As soon as i get enough money	1
I already did for some websites.	8
They are a great organization.	3
Yes, and I am sure they will appreciate and need it.	3
I'll donate the whole amount.	3
You?	3
will you also give some money today?	4
A dollar?	3
The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	3
I have an idea.	3
That is something I do not think about.	3
ok so we agreed on a price?	3
So what exactly do they do to help these kids to reunite with their parents?	0
That is a huge impact.	3
At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	8
That's interesting.	3
Are we attempting to agree on a donation amount?	3
i am from oakham	3
i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	3
ok how about 20 cents.	3
Is there any concrete proof that they do?	6
Every child deserves to have nutritious food.	3
How are you today?	3
I haven't.	3
im ok and you	3
Thank you.	3
Nice!!!	3
maybe i will do	2
I'd be glad to support the cause	3
For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	3
what happened?	3
I would like to know more about this charity	0
Or do they operate primarily in America?	0
Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.	3
Sure.	3
Thank you and have a great day	3
Makes sense you gotta keep the engine running.	3
yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	8
What other countries are they working in right now?	0
I do donate sometimes, yes.	3
o.k. 20 cents for now agreed and regular for 6 months, o.k.?	3
thank you.	3
What are some of the things that they do for the children?	0
I have a passion for helping children also.	3
do you donate to them?	4
And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	3
Ah ok very nice.	3
How much is a good donation?	3
However, I usually just give where I feel I need to and if people use it the wrong way, I believe they will get what's coming to them.	3
Right on so I will give $0.15:)	3
in all 50 states?	0
What do you like about them?	0
I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	3
yes im looking at it now actually it seems like a great foundation	3
hi i am fine..	3
That's good.	3
Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.	3
I am more willing to help a charity that will help right here in America	8
That seems so hard to believe, but I guess lots of pennies still add up!	3
Thank you!	3
No, not really.	3
I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	3
Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence	3
Cool no problem	3
that's great maybe we could both donate to them	3
It really sounds like a blessing!	3
What are the amounts for monthly subscriptions?	0
You do make a point.	3
I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics	3
There are so many charities that claim to do the same things.	3
That's wonderful!	3
this is so good.	3
I moved to the US and things are much better now	3
Sometimes I'm cautious of donating, just because I want to know that they're making the difference that they saw they are.	2
how are you?	3
very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children	8
I've been thinking of donating to charity, but I could never find the right one.	8
I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.	3
It's really cool.	3
However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	3
Yeah - all good things	3
How are you?	3
Hello	3
Oh, thanks for the website, I am sure that it has a lot of information that I could use to learn more about it.	3
I also have a child, so I understand where you're coming from.	3
right, well i feel horrible only saying $0 but i will say $0.00 because i want to go the website with my daughter and look it over and then donate there so she can be part of it	9
All we could do is our part since problem is so big.	3
do you do any volunteer work?	3
It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.	3
I feel very strongly about "our own children" !!	3
And thanks for helping!	3
I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	3
What if i'd like to donate more	3
Very true!	3
My wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	7
what is the website?	3
Every month I always try to donate a little to charity	8
Good morning.	3
Yes, I'm interested.	3
It was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.	6
Hello tell me something good	3
How would I donate directly from this task?	3
Good morning, I think children are so important and charities that involve them are needed and we should participate our money or our time.	3
Yes, I have!	3
i do like to donate to charities and this one sounds good because i want to help children but how do i know they are legit?	6
thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	3
How much do they recommend you donate?	3
That's a really good number considering the overhead that must be required for international relief.	3
I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	3
Yeah?	3
I can give $0.60 cents.	3
yeah I heard a little bit about on how children are suffering.	3
I think everyone kind of forgot that those affected still need help	3
How much money a year does save the children raise?	0
No i have not	3
Thank you.	3
yes I have two a boy and a girl.	3
okey.	3
no i am okay with this amount	3
I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	3
I'm not sure if I want to, but I can give a little.	2
I would like to donate half of my payment.	3
ok thank you sounds good,	3
Is there a follow up on to see how my money while little is may be is being put to use?	0
Would $1 help at all?	3
I have to make it more than 3 words	3
So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?	3
Simple Google search.	3
Hope you have lots of fun at the carnival!	3
Hey I'm fine.	3
I am pretty sure they do.	3
Haha.	3
What is the average donation amount that most donors contribute at one time?	0
thanks, same to you.	3
I know hunger is a big issue for a lot of people in other countries.	3
I then can see the money at work.	8
Hey, I'm doing great, how are you?	3
I'll donate a $1.	3
yes of course	3
I think it is a good organization.	4
I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.	8
okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	8
I was just looking through the morning mail.	3
How do YOU feel about the work this organization does?	4
Glad they are helping out	3
i hope the same for you also!	3
Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	3
yes, that is fine	3
Do the donations actually help the organization?	0
What charity are you involved in?	3
But I have money that I can donate.	3
30 dollars a month can change a child's life	3
What kind of things do they help with?	0
Yes.	3
No problem, what day is the charity meet up then?	3
That is very generous!	3
I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	3
There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	3
I feel really torn about the crisis.	3
I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.	8
Hi, i'm doing great! how are you?	3
How much are you donating?	4
How much am I allowed to donate?	3
Clear financial reports are a very good thing.	3
I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	3
ok so i will donate $25 to Breed the children right?	3
Man, the site sounds good.	3
I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	3
Hello there!	3
How much many are we talking and how you want me to pay	3
That seems worthwhile.	3
I have to get going.	3

Would you mind explaining what the charity does?	0

No, I actually haven't .	3

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	4

Every now and then I volunteer within my community.	3
I am all for helping children in any way possible.	3

Well theres a charity called Skateistan that is championed by the famous skater Tony Hawk And the majority of their donations go to direct service and help children out all of the world whom live in the most vulnerable situations.	3
Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	7

I think it's great and I love that they help kids to reunite with their families.	3

I've heard of Red Cross	8
I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	8
I completely agree with you.	3
i do very much yes	3
I have and I have heard good things about the charity.	3
I will gladly .	3
I am so sorry to hear about the little guy and how his birthday, too.	3
Fine how are you?	3
I have as well.	3

Sure!	3
Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	3
I am doing fine.	3
I hope my donation helps a lot of people.	3
But I don't have money to donate.	7
are they buying new schoolls with this money, new books, clothes, shelter or is the president of the charity using my donation to get a mercedes benz?	0
It is going alright, thanks	3
I believe it could be true.	3
So, do we need to chat back and forth a few for times for this to be over?	3
What is the easier way?	3
Thanks for talking me thru this today!	3
that's good to hear.	3
Absolutely, they are the future generation and it's imperative that they are nurtured and looked after.	3

We could either donate money or our time.	3
I couldn't agree more.	3
I think I've seen their commercials.	6
How much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?	3
Pennies matter to me.	7
Have you ever donated to this organization and if so, how much?	4
Yes, let's donate $0.30 each.	3
How does that equate to reporting financial information?	5
I'm not certain if that's scripted or not but if it isn't there's a better way to word that and if it is I think the person who wrote it might need to retire because they clearly come from the 50s.	5
Hello	3
That is amazing.	3
Those are very good questions.	3
That's great.	3
Ok.	3
Very well, thank you.	3
That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	3
No I have not	3
Do they help adults?	0
Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	3
yes i could do that	3
I don't believe it.	6
Or do you also volunteer your time?	4
yes I have in going to donate	3
You also have a good day	3
wow no i did not	3
While im in the grave cause I didnt have enough money to buy that bag of chips....	7

You will as well for all the hard work you're putting towards this magnificent charity.	3
That is awesome.	3
Do you already donate to them?	3
i actually did but never had a chance to do so	3
Will you be doing so as well?	3
My mother and father both have a PhD so their jobs made possible for us to be able to cover all that and so much more	3
I will take the option of donating into consideration.	1
How do I do that?	3
I am willing to match your donation.	3
Are you going to donate?	3
You are pretty awesome yourself!	3
Unfortunately, I have to take care of my kids, too, and can't afford to help more.	7
How do you suppose we do that?	6
How much will you be donating?	3
OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	3
Yes I know.	3
I am really interested.	3
I've heard of them.	3
What is the womens name that founded it?	0
You too,was a pleasure!	3
They have a lot of information there.	3
Excellent.	3
Will you be donating?	3
Thank you Glad I was able to helpthis organization with my donation	3
we have to chat so ask a question	3
I think I would be willing to donate a portion.	3
Thats very beneficial.	3
You convinced me that it's a worthwhile charity.	3
what about you?	3
Where can I read more about this organization and possible give a donate?	0
Is this primarily in African and South America?	0
amassing!	3
5$ maybe, plus minus, why?	3
Hi I am fine and yourself?	3
I think we have a few turns to go	3
I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	3
Save the Children sounds like a good charity to me as well.	3
Is there another way to donate?/	3
I think I've heard of them, but aren't they religiously affiliated?	0
no this is my first time.	3
I wish you all luck in that.	3
I know of many that I do not support due to the 6 figure salaries of the CEO.	6
I'd do .15 with splitting	3
That is awesome then I will donate $1.	3
It feels like so little, but if a lot of people do just a little bit, it really adds up!	3
It takes a lot to fix this country already so your effort is definitely astounding.	3
sure would love to	3
Have you ever donated?	4
Children are our future.	3
i know it will	3
I don't really have anything to give right now, but I will donate at another time when I have steady income.	1
I don't mind helping those abroad.	3
Are you donating to them?	3
The kids dying is really disturbing.	3
yeah, i mean, i guess	3
Hi.	3
Do you donate to children's charities often?	3
Sure thing.	3
It would be more, but not without more research.	3
I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	9
I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.	7
Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	0
Great what about you?	3
The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.	3
I did actually, but i can't remember the.	3
That would be alright.	3
In Africia, Asia, etc.	0
Hello there	3
If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	4
I want the money to do with as I choose.	8
How is your day going so far?	3
Thanks.	3
How would I go about this?	3
I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	1
What makes them untrustworthy?	3
I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.	9
No, but i will definitely donate within next two months	1
That's wonderful.	3
Again not my issue	4
Thank you.	3
I am reviewing the site right now.	3
How did Save the Children help?	3
Yes, definitely.	3
Yes.	3
What is the purpose of the charity?	0
Do you know what these children are suffering from and what the money will be funding?	0
and the money goes complety to the charity or does a part stay for handeling and administration	0
that's a fair point	3
I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs.	6
I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward.	3
What can you tell me about it?	3
yes i am.	3
Do they provide legal help or support to live?	0
It sounds familiar though.	3
How long have you been donating?	3
How are you?	3
i didnt know till now , you verified what i heard , they are making something beautiful for the people of Hawaii .	3
Children are the futere	3
How much of my donation goes to the kids	0
But we can't help them directly.	3
What are you primary motivations for making the donations?	3
I am thinking of 50 cents.	3
Thank you so much!	3
I feel sorry for them and would like to help them as much as possible	3
Would you mind telling me about it?	3
Nice!	3
How would i go about donating today	3
Yes.	3
I would be willing to donate 5 cents today.	3
That's a whole lot of rice and flour.	3
therefore we should do our best to make that happen	3
ok thank alot	3
Is ther any other charities you're fond of?	8
I hope so, maybe I can do more in the future.	3
i have not tell me about them	0
Could you tell me about it?	3
Doing MTurk to get my student loans paid off so that I can be more generous as a whole.	7
Do you know that charity's mission?	0
It's great to hear there are people out there doing such important work.	3

I will give $0.20	3
Sounds like they do a lot of good for a lot of people around the world.	3
Yes they will	3
I sponsor 3 children.	3
So if i donate will 100% of my donation go to a child?	6
How can I help?	3
I don't really have a team, but I like baseball.	3
good charity.	3
That sounds like a worthwhile cause.	3
I am interested.	3
You are welcome.	3
And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?	6
I usually like to donate to more local charities, this way it seems safer to actually go where it is needed and it is for poor homeless kids around my own area	8
Yea, hello.	3
do they help kids in africa	0
oh so specifically in third world countries were they are mistreated or does it include first world countries as well?	3
Yes that is an amount I feel comfortable with.	3
I like to help people that are close to home.	8
No i would be interested in learning	3
Thank you for your time.	3
Definitely, Are you interested in such things?	3
Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	7
Wow that is a lot of options.	3
Yes I have Heard	3
So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	3
I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	3
No I haven't.	3
It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate.	3
I feel bad about only giving $5, do you think we should give more?	0
I have an affinity for children.	3
That is amazing.	3
I agree, the local charities are good.	8
Awesome, I'll head over there right now and support it thank you.	3
Approximately how many children per year receive help?	0
I believe it!	3
Do you like that charity?	6
That sounds perfect	3
yes that is	3
no i have not but i am interested!	3
This time I like to do 0.50 since I also know that the charity is legitimate.	3
are you thinking about donate to the cause?	4
I suppose that is true.	3
Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it?	3
I do not do this "only" for the money, but to try and help any way I can.	3
I am sceptical of many of them but if you recommend Save The Children and I know that St Judd's is trustworthy, then that's where my money will go today	3
Okay, I will think about it.	3
it's a Monday, but a good start to the week!	3
okay done.. thanks	3
Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention	3
I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	8
Yes, For child care.	3
This is a worthy organization because many children receive some benefits	3
Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.	7
Shelter?	0

I like to learn as much as I can about an organization before donating.	3

Nearly 90?	0
Nice to meet you as well have a good one :)	3
We work for everything that we have.	7
It doesnt include extras that all CEO's receive.	6
ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month	4
Hi there.	3
Thank you.	3
I definitely will check it out.	1
Lol.I'm not a bot......	3
That's always good, it's not good to donate somewhere that they don't give to what they're supposed to be donating to	6
i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	3
Ill donate $0.30.	3
yeah sure, why not	3
We sponsor a child in El Salvador, we have been going it a number of years.	3
I saw a disheartening bstory on the news about some children that were injured due to that very violence.	3
I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	3
Do you know how much of the donation goes to the children?	0
I am so happy I can help.	3
The issue with children poverty has to change.	3
What about you?	4
You as well.	3
I accept your view and it is necessary that everyone should contribute at least to some extent to children's charity	3
I don't understand what you mean	3
I'm great.	3
it is an NGO, yes ofcourse many times I have considered to donate them as per my ability	3
Okay.	3
That'd be fantastic!	3
yes thats nice	3
money?	3
When was this charity started?	0
How much are you looking for?	3
I'm good, how are you?	3
I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	3

I'd love to hear more.	3
What do you think?	4
Ok, sounds great!	3
Thank you For being able to be so kind hearted as well hope u have a great day and keep a smile on your face ;)	3
I think this is a fair percentage to have.	3
I believe in that	3
Not interested right now to do so.	9
i feel like i need to do something like that	3
I think it was from Save The Children.	3
Oh, I didnt know we could do another one?	3
I'd like more information, yes.	3
sure, I'll donate $0.05.....	3
such sweet creatures.	3
It seems like Syria seems to be a high stakes area.	3
ugh yeah, i've seen that, you sit there waiting forever for someone to type two words haha	3
Okay, that sounds great!Thanks!	3
interesting.	3
Thank you so much for your time and the effort you are putting towards this very reputable charity!!	3

That is freat!!	3
That is why i am asking you for the details.	3
What made you interested in this charity and not another one?	4
Fine.	3
Thank you!	3
Ok, I saw the website and I am willing to donate $10	3
If I donate, even a little, I want it to actually go towards what it should, not just lining the pockets of the CEO.	6
I also hate seeing children so helpless.	3
How much is the typical donation amount usually?	3
Oh wow, I would also be interested in donating to that.	3
That is appealing.	3
Well, I don't have much money right now.	7
Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	3
not my time anymore no...too busy	3
Oh that's great!	3
I've never been on an MTurk Hit like this.	3
If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	3
I am glad to help!	3
Thats program services not to the kids themselves.	6
You sure?	3
I have considered donating to St Jude also because they provide life saving medical care.	3
ok. than how is you family	3
I am lost.	3
You need to type faster.	3
Thank you for your donation!	3
I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.	8
I'm not sure how much I would be getting from the task, but I will say $1!	3
My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	3
It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	3
What do you do in the organization?	3
It sounds like fun.	3
he was in the end i think, this is the kind of things i have about our civilization , many dnt have to eat and many waste their food, its not right	3
I think it's 10 exchanges	3
I would like to help in the future when I am more financially stable.	7
All of my payment, the entire $2.	3

I'm glad you understand my concern about scams.	3
Yes, I do	3
If I have a chance to donate when I'm a bit more financially stable, I will donate more.	1
I hope the money donated goes directly to them and not in the pockets of those running the organization.	3
That's encouraging.	3
Yes but that is a private issue between me and me, not you and me.	3
what would my donation go toward?	0
is $20 okay?	3
I don't	3
That sounds great.	3
It makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would I cope?	3
Thank you very much.	3
not so fast what does the money go to	0
I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	3
i will donate more than $100	3
I've heard of them.	3

Ha ha.	3
Is there a minimum amount you need to donate?	0
Yes, but I don't know a lot about them.	3
Can you tell me about it?	0
We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	4
I would if I had at least $200 in my bank account.	7
It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	3
Wonderful.	3
I believe in this charity, but still wonder how much of the money I donate actually helps.	8
What types of programs does it offer?	0
It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	3
How long have you been involved?	0
I have seen a lot of people do the same.	3

I am thinking I only want to donate .10	3
Yes, i agree	3
Hey how are you today?	3

They help a lot of city kids.	3
i understad you	3
What about you?	3
Yes, I do.	3
I'm fine with staying at $0.50 as long as you are	3
I'm pretty poor.	7
They are helpless.	3
I'm aware of how to donate and how easy it is.	3

I am well.	3
What is the range of options?	3
What kind of children's charities do you think are the most important?	0
thanks!	3
I would be willing to donate to this organization.	3
Most of time we have to depend on someone to help them.	3
Is there like, an average donation or something?	3
Yes I don't mind if there is a feature I can turn on where every hit I do, a few cents go to the charity of my choice.	3
a few times	3
Children are one of the worlds most important assets.	3
Ok how much do you need?	3
There are many homeless adults and adolescents that do not know where their next meal is coming from, or if it will ever arrive.	5
Where does the other money go?	0
what exactly happened to these children's?	0
I will have to take a look at the website.	1
i use to	8
How much are you giving?	4
I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.	6
I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	3
Have you ever donated to them?	3
I want to donate at least 50 dollar maximum would be 200 dollar.	3
i did only charity walks and rare to take the donations	3
that is very good to know	3
Good just another Monday how about yourself?	3
I haven't counted but we must be very close.	3
The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	3
Does Save the Children help find a place for refugees?	0
Yea, ive came across it a few times on different internet ads.	3
That way, you know what the money is being used for.	6
There are so many worthy causes that I try hard to make sure my meeker amounts go to benefit the most.	3
I know it does I'll donate 5 dollars	3

Monthly or one-time?	3
Do you donate to this cause as well?	3
Wow, that's very generous.	3

Sure I would	3
You have my attention, however this HIT is running Very long for 2 bucks already.	3
Hey!	3

What about Big Brother, Big Sister, they are very much in need of donations	4
Do you donate to a specific child?	0
Just got back from the gym	3
Thank you too.	3
No problem.	3
I think it's because there are more people who have experienced injustice or have been hurt by inequality.	3
Thats good, I see they are ready to help out with the hurricane in Hawaii for the kids.	3
I would think it is very valuable	3
does it do any work in the USA?	0
I could give 5 more cents but that is all for now.	3
ok cool is there a website?	0
I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.	3
Right now, I think I can spare a penny. :)	3
Perhaps I could help out a little.	3
I am proud to be apart of helping them help others	3
Thank you for your guidance.	3
How long has Save the Children been around?	0
How are you?	3
I would donate $10 to this charity	3
I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	3
We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	3
Okay so are you trying to get me to donate?	3
North Carolina, I've been to Florida once, it's nice.	3
Yes, because it is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	3
What is your recommendation on how we can help	3
Have you ever heard of evangelism?	5
I may consider a donation.	3
Of course I'll donate something	3
I spend more than that on coffee every week!	3
yes i am.	3
Yes that is correct	9
Could you QUICKLY tell me about it	0
i get that.	3
I agree that you have to be careful.	3
Well yeah that's why im giving them the dollar?	2
i donate every six months	3
hi	3
That's nice.	3
Great, thank you!	3
Ok thats great.	3
I have donated to them in the past.	3
I would like to donate $10	3
I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?	0
That sounds like a worthwhile cause	3
That's nice.	3
donating money to them	3
It is in fact 10 or 5% of my weekly income.	3
I dealt with that more when I was working.	3
Maybe you could tell me more about this charity	3
This goes into a different fund.	9
Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?	0
How are you?	3
thank you.	3
No, to be honest I am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	3
What about you?	4
I pay money to the Royal National Institute for the Blind.	3
I would be interested in doing do, however I must tell you I am generally very skeptical about charity orginizations in general.	6
I would like to know more before i donate.	0
No, I honestly don't have any money.	7
it does.	3
yes, sure sir	3
Hello, I am fine, how about you?	3
Sure, I will donate 10 cents	3
ok great-who is the research team?	3
that sounds meaningful.	3
Especially if they are children.	3
Are we being selfish by keeping half?	3
I have never seen this organization help them.	8
Glad this worked out!	3
Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	3
maybe	3
I agree it's for a good cause.	3
I don't believe so.	6
I will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.	3
What did you get him?	0
Do you have kids?	3
Okay.	3
I see - how many years have you been with them	3
What do you know about the charity?	0
What's your feelings about giving to children's charities?	3
It is worldwide or one specific country?	0
It's great to earn extra money here and there.	3
Sounds wonderful!	3
Are you looking for a donation for the charity?	3
Can you tell me more about it?	0
I'm not sure I understand what you said just now.	3
I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?	3
I guess they save children	3
I think it would in many places	3
How does it help children?	0
That's right, thanks for showing me the page, I will help many children, today I want to sponsor 3	3
No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.	3
That is very true.	3
save the children is a good choice.	3
where are the children from?	0
Glad to help.	3
I feel that donating is an ethical reason to give your tithes and offerings	3
Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.	3
If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	3
What else can you tell me about the charity?	0
I agree.	3
Thanks for the info, guess I am skeptical.	3
Walks with the dog sound awesome.	3
your very welcome	3
I realize that	3
Right, but I would like to know specifically what organization.	0
I'm very sorry I can't donate more tonight.	9
But I do agree with the points you made in support.	3
I would love to donate $.50 cents	3
How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	0
Hello, yes I have but I am not sure what the charity works towards	0
That sounds good, thank you for being charitable.	3
What a great charity, is there anything I can do to help?	3
It's not a huge amount but unfortunately I have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	7
that is not bad I could probably do that.	3
Yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need !	3
What about helping children who are living in poverty in America.	4
5 percent i would donate	3
I'm surprised i've never heard about it! how do i know if it's legit and if money really go to help those kids	6
Yes I would be willing to donate.	3
I hope this kind of environment changes for them.	3
I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	3
Thank you for the information.	3
I hear ya!	3
More about the charity?	3
I appreciate your position, but what exactly is Save the Children and how do I know that money will truly be used to help kids?	0
I would be okay with donating $0.10 from the task payment towards the charity.	3
What children organization?	3
Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	0
Wow .	3
oh thats great i would donate 5 dollars then	3
ok thats great.	3
OK, i have donated to them before!!	3
Do you have the link to the site	0
It is horrifying, I could not even imagine.	3
I will donate 0.05 cents today.	3
I tend to read news articles from aboard. BBC, ect.	3
can't complain, youreslf?	3
Thank you for your recognition.	3
yes, I can do that.....	3
I think it is the least I could do.	3
Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.	3
That will have such a big impact on their lives.	3
No, I have never hear of it	3
Gotta feed the hungry first	3
I have heard of Save the Children but I'd rather keep my donations US-based	8
I have seen their adverts and campaigns.	3
i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?	4
Good point, I think I may consider it	2
Its paying me .30	3
Please explain to me in detail	3
We should donate money then.	3
I've been following the news about family separations very closely.	3
Just recovering from the long weekend.	3
I kind of saw some stuff about them on the news.	3
Its because I dont trust non profits	6
I donate to a lot of different causes but am happy to pitch in.	3
It depends on the way they see it.	3
Are findings tax deductible?	3
Do you usually donate?	3
That is amazing!	3
You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	3
I think I have...	3
I think they are a trustworthy organization.	3
3 dollars	3
How long have you been supporting this charity?	3
What are the donations used for?	0
What do you do for Save the Children?	3
I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	3
What do you have in mind?	4
It's not much, but I don't have much money.	7
it is sad, i agree with you	3
i have three kids.	3
No, I haven't	3
Really gets the public's interest.	3
Absolutely.	3
I guess in America you don't really understand what other countries go through.	3
o.k. task done	3
Yes, I believe it is good to be ethical.	3
Hi	3
If I can vouch for them, yes.	1
I've given to a few charities before, but never this one.	8
Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	8
That is a noble cause.	3
Is there a minimum to donate?	3
Alright that's cool so how does this charity take its donations.	0
Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	3
I will donate 10 cents	3
hello	3
I hope you still have a good week!	3
yes i am very much sure.	3
I am sure there are many ways to help	3
That would be the most convenient thing for me.	3
It was lovely chatting with you.	3
very fair, it is good that all contribute little to the help of children all over the world	3
I am from the Midwest.	3
Sounds good to me.	3
Give me your details i will send you later on.	3
What are they?	3
How are you?	3
This is good thing.	3
Yes children should have access to healthcare and basics needs	3
Sure.	3
Yes, I would love some information.	3
Save the Children has not convinced me they can work towards accomplishing those tasks.	6
Let's make a donation.	3
Not even a little!	3
I'll donate but not that much	3
It sounds familiar.	3
I'm glad to hear that.	3
How are you?	3
We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.	3
Great job!	3
And its awesome that you help out those kids in need	3
I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	3
that sounds expensive	7
However I am not getting a reward from this hit.	3
what other organizations?	5
They are?	3
Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	0
what hobbies do you like?	3
All the way in Africa.	3
I guess we're supposed to be talking about a children's charity..?	3
Do you agree?	3
This will be my first time donating to this organization so sorry if I have a lot of questions about it.	3
Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.	3
What kind of children does it help?	0
Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	7
I'm doing well, a little tired.	3
That is great that they are there helping.	3
I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	3
No, please tell me more.	0
It depends on the charity!	3
I'm fine how are you.	3
I took a look at the website.	3
How do you receive payments?	3
Great!	3
I admire your effort reaching to people to help the charity.	3
That sounds good.	3
What would you say is the amount of a the common donation thatsomeone like myself would donate.	3
how would i do it now	3
sure I can donate but what is the game?	3
What are some of your hobbies?	3
Sure, I will match your $0.50.	3
Do how much are you donating	4
this is nice.	3
I can't imagine how terrible it must be for a child to grow up inside a war zone.	3
I understand.	3
Well I hope that my $1.10 helps those poor children and when i dont need to rely on HITs for money i'd love to donate more.	3
I'm glad you are fighting for a cause to help others.	3
A lot of charities are just a name and they don't do what they promise.	6
Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	3
I know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive.	3
Lets leave it at that.	3
In what ways do they help children?	0
Great, so do we keep talking for like 4 more turns?	3
yes I know	3
I feel good about this.	3
Who runs the organization now?	0
You have a good day as well.	3
Oh wow.	3
Have a great weekend!	3
I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.	3
What are your donations used for?	0
How do they do that?	0
That sounds interesting.	3
Telling me where it goes really does nothing for me.	6
If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	0
Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	3
I know it's not a lot, but it's all I'm willing to afford today.	3
I am not sure yet. What is their website?	3
It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country	5
I dont see why I wouldn't	3
What kind of work do they do?	0
What is it about?	0
Yes, it will be nice to know that I was able to give to them.	3
I know the children are very grateful!	3
awesome, thank you so much	3
My family would just get through somehow.	3
ok $25 sounds ok	3
How long have you worked there?	3
I'd donate 50 cents of my payment.	3
Good luck to you	3
How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	6
HI there!	3
i think one dollar will help	3
How much do you think that I should give?	3
I agree.	3
We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations	3
I do like the satisfaction of doing good work for and towards others.	3
I think I would be able to donate some of my earnings.	3
I'll donate 10 cents.	3
I would like to donate 5 dollars.	3
Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.	3
Of course I am very interested to donate funds to charity	3
I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.	3
yes I have.	3
I am sure there are people who need it more than me	3
Okay sounds interesting.	3
I don't believe I have.	3
I am sure they do.	3
They definitely do.	3
The violence in Syria is one of the saddest things happening in the world today, as far as I know.	3
I spend a lot of time in the shelter for them too.	3
can I confirm that you would also like to donate 5% of yours?	3
If more people gave, even it's a small amount, it truly adds up and can make a difference.	3
I would love to help them a little bit (as per my ability), it will also helpful for those children to have a better life than the others.	3
I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	3
You take care and have a good day.	3
In which countries do they serve?	0
how do you help them.	4
Yes.	3
Yes I have but don't know a whole lot about them since there are so many children related charities.	3
Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.	3
What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	3
I would be happy to listen.	3
I don't currently, I have donated to an animal shelter a few months ago however.	3
I see no reason not to help this charity.	3
No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	3
Thats awesome!	3
That's funny that you mention that.	3
Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	3
How much are you donating?	4
We really are.	3
Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt.	3
This will be ten for each of us.	3
Oh i bet. I would love to hear stories about the children that have been saved	3
How does this work?	3
Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?	0
I'll look into the website and likely donate $5.	1
Thank you for your time and information!	3
i have not, can you tell me more?	0
yes! i said that's a fair point.	3
ok.	3
They do lots of TV adverts.	3
I donate to many local charities in my city.	3
Yea what do you got?	3
I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	3
In the scheme of things, a life is a life, but I am American and feel it important to help my fellow Americans	4
I haven't, is that a charity?	6
I feel like it's a shame and I wish we could do more.	3
I will donate $0.25	3
I enjoyed this.	3
I was glad to hear that.	3
Oh ok.	3
I hope it is helpful to the children	3
We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	3
Hiya	3
I would do the same	3
i would like to donate .05 cents	3
What kinds of things do children's charities do?	0
I agree.	3
Can you please explain more about it?	0
How about .20?	3
OK sounds good.	3
global?	0
That is convenient!!!	3
OK thanks.	3
They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	3
I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.	3
ok, I'll do $1 but I want to know your mturk worker ID to prove it's a person	3
where are you	3
I would be interested in making a donation	3
wow that is neat	3
I don't think I'm quite ready to decide yet though.	2
i like to help since people have helped me	3
true, we live a life and it would be more fun to live beautifully and happily but not only for ourselves but to be happy for all the people who surround us somewhat	3
I'm doing well.	3
That's nice.	3
what will you do with this money.	0
thank you!	3
Have you ever donated to them?	3
There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	6
in what way?	3
Have you ever thought about the benefits from the donations?	0
I will donate 50 cents	3
That's awful.	3
do you donate often?	3
If you could donate some money today, how much would you donate?	4
I think so.	3
I am one who like to donate.	3
Yeah I've seen a lot of the news on Syria, it's horrible.	3
That's true.	3
Like a newsletter?	3
Thanks for making me aware of this charity!	3
Just to confirm, I'm donating 80% of my task amount.	3
Great.	3
That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.	5
every other month or so, but not to them	3
That's nice.	3
I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	3
Is there a reason children in particular are so special to you?	3
I'll donate .50.	3
Hello how are	3
(1, o.k. let's say 1600 dollares total, o.k.?	3
That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	3
Perfect thank you for the information.Is there a website where I can check it out and donate?	0
When iIsaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iIshould not have ised that term, nor did I mean it lightly, I meant physically donating time and skills.	3
I have heard about it.	3
I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.	3
Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.	8
It is very refreshing to see.	3
Well how do i make a donation to them?	0
you also done a great job	3
I will not donate anything $0.	9
If sometimes I go down the street and there are people with posters I raise money for children and I always give them something because it is a good cause	8
Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.	5
I love children.	3
Is it about the civil war in Syria?	0
If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	0
Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something.	3
I want to thank you again for bringing awareness to this important charity.	3
Lets do $1.00 for now but I am glad you have made me aware of an organization that I can look into in order to help others.	3
It sounds familiar.	3
and what country or countries are these children located in	0
Where did you get that information and who specifically is the money going to?	0
That is a good way to think about it.	3
The donations to heal and help with health issues is very crucial	3
Glad to see it goes to shelter, clothing, and food.	3
usually thats how you persuade ppl to donate.	0
sound good.	3
That is something I could really get behind.	3
I wish this wasn't true.	3
Do you donate money only?	4
I have heard about it but I do not know wgat they do	3
I already checked it out and it seems pretty good.	3
I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.	6
I don't know much about their events.	3
I want to help out as much as I can.	3
Thank you, I would like to make a 50 dollar donation but first.	0
If everyone would just give something, everyone could have food and a warm place to sleep.	4
And why do so many of these countries continually need help?	4
I did not know that.	3
O I have heard of Save the children.	3
Hello	3
Ok, I would like to.	3
Well it is a bit rainy, and it has been cold, but we are going to get a heat wave in the high 80's this week!	3
how do i make the donation?	0
I have just done some quick research and am inclined to donate when I have the opportunity.	3
Do they have any focus right now?	0
ok, good deal, $0.50 it is.	3
yes thats ok	3
I think we have to complete 10 turns, so here's to another one!	3
62% is amazing.	3
If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.	3
i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	3
from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	4
Thank you, have a great day!	3
Okay, thank you.	3
Can you tell me more about it?	0
Have a great day.	3
How do you feel about that?	3
thats good children deserve it	3
I have!	3
I feel the happiest man in the world when I donate some help if she is, I feel very good when my help is happening to people	3
I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	3
why do you don't want to donate?	4
have a great day too	3
I'm good.	3
I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?	3
I think Red Cross does a broad array of services	3
I will donate half of my earnings.	3
Things like that?	0
I would perhaps be interested can you tell me more a bout it	0
Thank you and I do not want to be rude but I am straight talking person	3
hi, how are you?	3
Happy to be able to help such a worthy cause!	3
Ok I will be willing to donate $100.	3
I could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?	0
It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	3
Half of whatever I am going to get paid for this task	3
I'm a little familiar with the charity though.	3
i'm glad to help	3
$0.10-Can you see this?	3
Can you tell me more about what they do?	0
Unfortunately I don't have much money right now to help.	7
ok.it only pays $0.30 though	3
I have not heard of Save the Children?	3
Hello	3
I make money as a musician so basically I don't make money.	7
how long was the charity been run	0
I work with children who have terminal illnesses.	3
Hmm, I can do maybe 100.	3
I would lock into half.	3
I am an informed donor and want to make sure my money is really helping these children	0
I do not, can you tell me some?	0
Good, What do you think is the greatest social issue we are facing right now?	3
I will look at the website after this survey and read more about it..I promise	1
Works better on skeptics.	3
Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	3
Whatever my task payment will be.	3
Do you work for them or have you donated with them before?	3
WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	3
Maybe I will have to do some research first.	1
Ok, that's great.	3
Does it help children in this country or in another country?	0
That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	3
I'd rather contribute my donation locally.	8
Like.	3
how much should i give?	3
Col.	3
I've done that before on other tasks.	3
That sounds right from what I know.	3
that is not bad	3
I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	3
I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	3
same to you and good night	3
Sounds like a good mission, but I probably won't be able to donate	9
yeah i know how donation works.	3
I recognize it too.	3
Sure, I will donate 50 cents to them.	3
Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	3
where is this organization based?	0
I think it's time to take a walk a little later!	3
I hate to be so prejudicial, but I care about the kids around me more than ones I cannot see!	3
There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	6
hello how are you	3
Sure.	3
wow that is a huge number isnt it	5
That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!	3
How often are you able to do that?	3
