Well how do i make a donation to them?	6
Have you ever heard of evangelism?	5
That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.	5
ohh how much donation would yoy expect?	0
Great.	0
That seems so hard to believe, but I guess lots of pennies still add up!	0
If a charity is doing good work to feed the hungry, I will give what I have to spare.	0
I believe it could be true.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you!	0
What do you dislike about the organization	0
Switching tasks all the time can be very difficult.	0
I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	9
I'll gladly give all of my payment.	0
They have no choice but to rely on others.	0
That's terrible.	0
Wow, that definitely puts it in perspective!	0
A ten dollar donation sounds reasonable to me.	0
I'll do $20.	0
How can I help?	0
But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.	0
I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	0
Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?	6
Hey how's it going?	0
ok.it only pays $0.30 though	0
same thanks for the advice have a good one keep spreading love	0
i dont know	0
Okay so are you trying to get me to donate?	0
So I have much empathy for these children and their needs.	0
Does this money provide help for the kids in their own country or is it used to bring these children over to the United States?	6
$1.50 sounds good then.	0
We really are.	0
okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?	2
yes definitly develop for education	0
I have been research the Make-A-Wish foundation.	0
Not really.	0
I'm doing well.	0
The kids dying is really disturbing.	0
Do you?	0
they are hungry and injured and also short	4
5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	0
I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!	0
Which children?	0
I have thought about it in the past.	0
If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?	0
That is at least something.	0
i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	0
Ok. Utilizing the resources from the research team, what are some challenges for children's education in developing countries?	6
Believe me, if it were any charity besides "save the children," you could have me donate my entire compensation, which isn\'t really all that much.	9
I will give .20	0
Welcome, thanks for talking	0
We work for everything that we have.	4
How are you doing?	0
I don't want to donate a dollar, but would consider donating something less.	0
Then in the future, I can donate more.	0
I hope to be able to do that someday.	0
yes i am very interested!	0
Why yes I have.	0
Now you're just messing with me intentionally.	0
Does your organization provide receipts, for tax purposes?	6
Feeling great.	0
I would like to read a little about the charity before donating.	8
Ok thank you.	0
Oh wow that is good to know.	0
I almost never donate.	3
You too!	0
I would like to go to some of the countries and help in person too.	0
I appreciate you trying to get me to though.	0
I will copy and save the website address.	0
how do you help them.	2
6 dollars is good	0
I need the money as well	4
Good for you!	0
Oh for sure.	0
Yes I do.	0
Hi.	0
Yes!	0
thanks!	0
It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate.	0
who do they help	6
No I think they use most of their donations to actually help children.	0
Okay, where are the major areas you serve?	6
it's a Monday, but a good start to the week!	0
are they buying new schoolls with this money, new books, clothes, shelter or is the president of the charity using my donation to get a mercedes benz?	6
I agree.	0
Why not Antartica?	5
Yes, I believe it is good to be ethical.	0
Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	0
Is there a website where i can donate?	6
tell me more?	0
Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	0
I have donated $100	0
I could definitely justify giving $20 to them.	0
Helping children is important.	0
Besides working in the morning, I plan to go out to a concert with a few friends on Saturday, so that should be fun.	0
I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate.	3
it's so heartbreaking	0
Do you know of any other childrens charities?	0
I'm glad a charity like that exists internationally.	0
Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	0
I can donate .10 of my mturk earnings.	0
not much maybe a couple dollars every few months	0
I feel the happiest man in the world when I donate some help if she is, I feel very good when my help is happening to people	0
That is awesome that your friend does that!	0
Ditto for their problems with the energy company in 2013.	9
I do donate sometimes, yes.	0
I'm always about children.	0
yes i know that is a good charity foundation, they help the children.	0
What type of agreement are they talking about?	0
Glad to know it will go to a child in need.	0
Thought this was hypothetical.	0
doing good you?	0
Have you made a donation to this organization before?	0
I moved to the US and things are much better now	0
No I would not	1
in all 50 states?	6
How would I know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity	9
That's right, how do you help children?	0
I bet the kids there are in need.	0
Right, but I would like to know specifically what organization.	6
It really upsets me	0
You.	0
They want to make sure it doesn't happen to the ones that come after us.	0
We're here to talk about a children's charity, is that right?	0
I've heard of poorly run charities that misuse the donations.	9
It's a very noble cause.	0
ok what can i help with that	0
That sounds good.	0
These are good things to donate for, but I still don't know exactly how my, or anyone's donations are used directly.	6
Paypal is usually my choice.	0
I feel like they'll just take my donation and get their tax credit.	9
will you also give some money today?	2
yes of course	0
So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	0
Are you certain that the money will be used the right way?	9
I recognize it too.	0
There is quite a bit of training and background checks, but it's worth it!	0
How are you?	0
I have to question that they have provided only tents.	2
Oh, ok.	0
Oh okay.	0
I think I've seen their commercials.	9
How much do you agree to?	0
I took a little time to look up information on the organization, but didn't see that.	0
Many of them lives on a war zone	0
I was not aware of that fact, no.	0
Thank you for linking the website, I will check it out right now.	0
i know i would like to help them with 5 dollars	0
I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	7
How much is the average donation	0
I wish I could do something to help.	0
Most of time we have to depend on someone to help them.	0
You take care and have a good day.	0
Exactly, in today\'s world one must be weary of scammers.	9
Great, I'm glad we're helping a little.	0
What do you have in mind?	0
such sweet creatures.	0
Especially with children.	0
Col.	0
Happy to be able to help such a worthy cause!	0
I think it would in many places	0
I can spare $25.	0
I'm great.	0
i'm listening	0
I understand.	0
Sorry Im getting off topic.	0
I would like to know more before i donate.	6
ok please do	0
I spend about 5 dollars a day, you?	0
Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	0
If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	4
No.	0
Yes, very often	0
All my kids love their security blankets.	0
good how about you?	0
Do you donate money?	0
I doesn't cost much.	0
I can't work all day.	4
bye now.	0
I am well today thank you.	0
Do you agree?	0
im not to sure yet	8
Does Save the children has the offices there?	0
Again, you're only giving me an opinion.	5
It's a shame, but I want her to know her rights so that she is never taken advantage of by someone in a higher position of power.	0
How are you?	0
Thank you and have a great day	0
I donate to my local charities, plus the United Way.	0
Hi!	0

What do you do as a volunteer for this charity?	6
What do you do for a living?	0
Thank you "PERSON_1"	0

More about the charity?	0
Hey I'm fine.	0
Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	6
Sometimes I'm cautious of donating, just because I want to know that they're making the difference that they saw they are.	8
I'll donate but not that much	0
Ill donate $0.30.	0
that's true.	0
I do not only help the children but everybody who needs some help if this financial or moral help	3

It takes a lot to fix this country already so your effort is definitely astounding.	0
Not only are they ravaged by the volcano, now a hurricane.	0

Children really need people to help them.	0
How long has Save the Children been around?	6

i would love to donate for childrens' cause	0
Hello, I am fine, how about you?	0
They have a lot of information there.	0

Your work is appreciated	0
May your days be pleasant, as well.	0

How are you	0
nope I have never heard of it	0
No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	1
I am proud to be apart of helping them help others	0
Would you whole heartedly donate?	9

I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.	9
What part of the world will it go to?	6
I will donate a portion of my payment.	0
Outstanding.	0
okay did you choose to donate?	2
It really sounds like a blessing!	0
How about you?	2
This is a worthy organization because many children receive some benefits	0
Hey how are you today?	0
Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	0
Great.	0
I think children need help.	0
very good, do you think they may just get the money and dont help no one?	9
You have made this a good learning experience and I feel confident in my donation to Save The Children.	0
It was lovely chatting with you.	0
I know that it is a good organization and I support them.	0
no Ill donate to local charities	3
True, especially if you take part in donating.	0
Are there different tiers of donations?	6
Save the Children International's CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt earned $299,136 in 2017.	0

chicago.	0

I have, actually.	0
Yes I have Heard	0
I will too.	0
I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	0

Thank you so much for your time and the effort you are putting towards this very reputable charity!!	0
No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.	0
ok nice.	0
I think i will make a donation of $2	0
This will impact my decision on how much to give.	6
i donate sometimes.	0
Hopefully we can move on soon to get back to other tasks.	0
Are you a top rated charity?	6
If everyone puts in there fair share then save the children would be even bigger, could you imagine how much children could be saved or help,or both	0
No there is not	0
Enjoy your day also.	0
Infomercials don't impress me.	9
I have heard of them, but have not looked into what they do.	0
Is it just in one country, or do they work around the world?	6
Yeah, totally!	0
They actually have an office near me then.	0
How are you doing today?	0
Thank you very much forthat info you have been very helpful!	0
That's good to know.	0
What does 5 dollars get these children?	6
I donate to a lot of different causes but am happy to pitch in.	0
Hello, I am doing good, alright lets get started!	0
Oh really?	0
That is convenient!!!	0
Would I find additional information about this charity in GuideStar?	6
Okay great, is there parking for the venue or should i get a taxi there?	0
That makes me feel much better.	0
I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?	0
I have not.	0
Awesome.	0
It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	0
you make me feel sad :( it hurts me to see the picture of the children, I want to donate everything	0
It would be more, but not without more research.	0
How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	6
we have to chat so ask a question	0
Thank you!	0
at least I try.	0
I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.	0
I would be willing to donate to this organization.	0
What do we need to work out and what would this donation be for?	0
The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.	0
No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	0
We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	2
I would love to make a donation today.	0
Yes, I've heard that before.	0
Okay that is nice and simple.	0
I am fine how are you?	0
I really like how groups of people come together to make up these organizations, it so nice to see them helping people, in this case children.	0
I'm great, how are you?	0
How are you?	0
i like to help since people have helped me	0
What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25	0
Good morning.	0
Ok well I know it is important for them to have basic needs.	0
Hello	0
That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that.	0
My families poor too and I don't get a lot of extra stuff like drinks and snacks.	4
What do you need me to do?	0
Health and education both are important factors	0
Although that one is easier to spin as seeking more money to fund more projects.	5
That sounds right from what I know.	0
yes they will	0
I do know save the children.	0
I will do $10 to both.	0
That's so important.	0
ok. than how is you family	0
Also I want to verify that this organization is most trusting.	0
I'm good.	0
I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.	9
I have not, but there are other charities I like to participate in	3
I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	0
what is it abuot?	6
If someone believes they can take advantage of your ignorance, a lot of times, they will.	0
I seethank you for your information.	0
Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	0
I haven't, is that a charity?	9
Sponsorship of a child might be interesting....I'd like to know what my donation is being used for, and that it's actually helping someone.	0
I'm well, thanks	0
Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.	0
That's good because hurricanes have devastating effects.	0
Oh, yep.	0
Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.	4
This is,URL??	6
Great!	0
okay im fine with that	0
Hi	0
This is good thing.	0
Its all good bud.	0
That is so nice of you.	0
How much do you want to donate?	0
That sounds awesome.	0
If sometimes I go down the street and there are people with posters I raise money for children and I always give them something because it is a good cause	3
How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	6
Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.	9
I have heard about it but I do not know wgat they do	0
Thank you, you too.	0
so you have completely trust your money would go where you intend to?	9
Thank you!	0
What does the money go towards if I donate?	6
Yes I would be willing to donate $1	0
I see, and it's called Save the Children	0
Children are the most vulnerable people in our society.	0
Yes I would be interested in doing so	0
Maybe ten dollars I can do.	0
I would perhaps be interested can you tell me more a bout it	6
Do they help adults?	6
nice to meet you, do you know any good children's charities	0
I'm not sure if I'm donating to you or if you're donating to me.	0
Sounds like they do a lot of different things for people.	0
I would like to donate $2 then.Thank you!	0
That will have such a big impact on their lives.	0
Helping people makes people feel good	0
It is hard to watch and not reach out to help a child.	0
I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.	0
What do volunteers do for this charity?	6
i am alway happy to help	0
I think I would be interested in the child sponsorship.	3
There are so many charities that claim to do the same things.	0
I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.	0
Yes, definitely.	0
I think it is also the right thing.	0
What is it all about?	0
What service does this charity provide?	6
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	0
No, I don't believe I have.	0
I always donate if it is for children causes.	0
You are a wonderful person.	0
Okay.	0
Again not my issue	2
Great.	0
You gotta make sure your donation is helping the needy.	9
ok, good deal, $0.50 it is.	0
I donated 1000 dollars to them.	3
Thanks for talking me thru this today!	0
I hope it is helpful to the children	0
Hello, I'm fine.	0
How much is a good donation?	0
You're right!	0
Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	0
No problem. I do understand how every little bit helps and how we do not have to give as much if we can get others involved and for a good cause.	0
That is very true.	0
I may do that.	8
That's encouraging.	0
i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount	3
They are a great organization.	0
Yes, I am thinking of donating to a childrens charity and I can now consider Save The Children.	0
The issue with children poverty has to change.	0
How long has the organization been established and what is the success rate of the program?	6
My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	4
I think every little bit helps but as a whole it's not enough.	0
I'm lucky to feed myself and my children, but I believe I could probably manage to send $5	4
hi	0
Thank you so much, same to you!	0
Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention	0
Do they have any focus right now?	6
I will spread the word!	0
Yeah I agree.	0
ok so we agreed on a price?	0
It sounds like my money won't be used to directly help the children.	9
Yeah, I have used Gospel for Asia in the past	3
Great talking with you.	0
Good to know.	0
True -- but how much money is currently being provided by US and NATO to help?	2
It feels like so little, but if a lot of people do just a little bit, it really adds up!	0
Do you donate to a specific child?	6
Wherever and whoever that may be.	0
Every month I always try to donate a little to charity	3
how do we do that	0
I am from USA.	0
yes i have	0
Oh wow.	0
That sounds great.	0
I like to be able to help as many as possible	0
Or are there any other payment options, as I have bills to pay.	0
yes i will.	0
I set aside a small personal charity fund each year so that I can contribute to my community.	3
is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	6
I am.	0
No i would be interested in learning	0
What do you have in mind?	2
Are they a non profit organization?	6
yes I have two a boy and a girl.	0
that's amazing!	0
I think this is all very interesting stuff.	0
no i dont think so i love the cause!	0
Have you ever made a donation to Save the Children or another charity?	2
I believe in that	0
Thats very beneficial.	0
It's definitely a motivator!	0
I wish I could do more	0
Is there a minimum to donate?	0
I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	4
What about controveries in 2009 regarding parents in Britain?	9
I'll agree to pay half.	0
I am sorry I am unable to help.	4
I have!	0
do you mean autopay from my payment checks ?	0
In fact, I believe they were a top-rated children's charity the last couple years.	0
Yes I would	0
I tend to make donations to a emergency children's shelter.	3
what is the organization ?	6
I am how are you doing?	0
I've donated to a few in the past	3
Do they help children right here in America	6
It doesn't take much sacrifice to think of small ways to help!	0
i get that.	0
That's very interesting, sounds like they do good work.	0
Okay.	0
That's fantastic.	0
Sounds good, please feel free to share!	0
Why should I donate to this one in particular?	0
No, but I see the work being done everyday in my community..	3
Hello	0
What is the total revenue?	6
That is a noble cause.	0
Exacally if 50cents can make a differnce in someones like and i can help im all for it !!	0
i really love helping people	0
This will be my first time donating to this organization so sorry if I have a lot of questions about it.	0
Yes, they need all the help they can get there after the missiles and chemical attacks	0
I would like to learn more about this organization.	6
then we have came to an agreement that went vary smoothly it says up top "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made so i think weve done .	0
Oh, that is nice!	0
yes i do	0
I am not saying that world charities are not needed but I rather give to local charities.	3
Currently I do not donate to charities.	3
Nope, mine doesn't maybe that was the point, to see if I would donate to just any charity. Still I always hope the money actually gets to them.	0
I think I'll probably donate at the end of this conversation.	0
You are very welcome.	0
My wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	4
Half of whatever I am going to get paid for this task	0
That is what I like to hear!	0
If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	0
Ok I will be willing to donate $100.	0
How do I know my money goes to the cause and not just to the pockets of the people that run it.	9
How do I know my money will go where it supposed to?	6
The photo would be nice, it would let me know and connect with someone I am helping.	0
Have a great day!	0
weell that sounds like a lovely charity.	0
Have a great weekend!	0
I already did for some websites.	3
Yes, please go ahead and tell me	0
Yes, I am sure you get a lot of storms.	0
Hiya	0
I think that you convinced me.	0
That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	0
Thats such a noble thing they are doing	0
What do they do?	6
That is super important work, obviously.	0
I haven't yet, but I am thinking about doing so in the future.	0
how do i make the donation?	6
That's actually quite reasonable!	0
I like to help people that are close to home.	3
St Jude's is another great organisation.	0
What kind of children's charities do you think are the most important?	6
I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.	0
Sure, what is it?	6
I like to donate.	0
I could definitely do that.	0
Yes but that is a private issue between me and me, not you and me.	0
Thank you for telling me about this organization	0
I have just done some quick research and am inclined to donate when I have the opportunity.	0
Children in this world is very important because they are so vulnerable and they are the future of this world.	0
No, to be honest I am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	0
lol	0
I already checked their website.	0
Hello there!	0
Not that, there are many needs in the world and this is a good cause	0
i love that so much of it goes towards the children	0
Great, and can i bring family members to the donation event?	0
That sounds like a good percentage and Im glad it will give me a tax break as well.	0
I believe it is- I've seen commericals for it on TV before....	0
Thank you for the information you provided.	0
That was interesting, it seemed to match the information on the independent review site.	0
Plus there are starving children right here in america	9
Ok great.	0
whetehr i acn trust this charity?	9
How do i donate?	0
Will it help towards education?	6

Do you work for them?	0
Great!	0
I would like to donate $0.	1
Good for them.	0
yes 0.15 is correcr	0
That's good of you to donate.	0
In which countries do they serve?	6
I agree with you!	0
I could even go for the whole $.30 if you want.	0
Well that's disappointing.	0
Have you donated to Save the Children before?	0
No problem, what day is the charity meet up then?	0
Where in the world are the children located?	6
Well, thank you for wishing me well.	0
No, I have not hear that	0
Thanks so much.	0
However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	0
Okay. I can donate $20.	0
I am aware of the violence in Syria but what has "Save the Children" done to aid in health, education and safety?	6
Do you know when the charity began?	6
same to you :)	0
oh yep thats very good i know these children needs help for sure	0
I look forward to working with Save the Children	0
In the scheme of things, a life is a life, but I am American and feel it important to help my fellow Americans	2
I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	0
very fair, it is good that all contribute little to the help of children all over the world	0
Approximately how many children per year receive help?	6
what is a recent successful program?	6
Thank you!	0
I think I can give $25.	0
I would like to donate	0
How do you feel?	0
I would certainly be willing to donate then	0
I've never heard of that one.	0
I understand that.	0
Right.	0
That is terrible.	0
thank u sir	0
I would definitely love to donate and get involved in any way I can.	0
Well, I grew up in a wealthy house.	0
Thats great, Thank You	0
It's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.	0
Thank you.	0
Okay.	0
Is this organization Christian or religious based?	6
That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?	6
Children should be with their parents!!	0
World Wildlife Fund: WWF, I like to support animals too if I can	3
I think I will donate $1, it only seems fair.	0
Oh i see.	0
Have you ever personally worked with them?	0
support children in more development country?	6
It is not a problem just for children.	5
i would give it all if i weren't	0
Yes I also like to donate to the children without parents and relatives.	0
oh ok. i love children's very much.	0
They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	0
Do you donate through MTurk only?	0
I am really interested.	0
So what do we do now?	0
Sure.	0
Would $1 help at all?	0
That would be the most convenient thing for me.	0
Ok good to know.	0
I have never sought out a charity and that brings up a good point.	0
I'm a little familiar with the charity though.	0
I may be interested.	0
I understand.	0
There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	0
I do donate to Ronald McDonald House and St Jude.	3
that sounds good	0
Nope, what do you recommend?	0
yes everything is high priced	0
Unfortunately I am having some money troubles right now so it's a little hard for me to promise any significant amount of money at the moment.	4
Education is must for everyone in the world.	0
How often are you able to do that?	0
What about this charity.	0
You must be so releived.	0
in one occasion trip to Latin America and there the situation is very sad, many children live in the street without anyone	0
Glad this worked out!	0
Yea?	0
I would think so?	0
The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.	0
How do you feel about donating to a children's charity?	2
I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.	3
Or do they operate primarily in America?	6
No, I honestly don't have any money.	4
sure, what's the website?	6
And to help children and animals as much as we can.	0
He even made it through college.	0
That sounds good, thank you for being charitable.	0
Yes. Save the children is a very nice organization	0
I am still not 100% confident this isn't a scam as it is all done via the computer and not face to face.	9
I accept that!	0
great, let me check it out	0
If I donated to every cause I would be giving away a lot of money and I already lose 20% to taxes.	4
Same here.	0
Do you like that charity?	9
Agreed, which is probably what they want.	0
I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.	3
No, I didn't see anything.	0
I feel really torn about the crisis.	0
Thank you.	0
I'd do .15 with splitting	0
Thank you.	0
I have heard of Save the Children but I'd rather keep my donations US-based	3
That's nice.	0
Ok-thanks-I will be waiting to hear from them	0
Depending on the amountI will match your donation but ONLY if you answer the following question: How do you feel about the organizations work?	0
what do you know about them are they a good charity?	0
That sounds great, What countries do they help children in?	6
It seems like they're involved in a lot of areas.	0
No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	0
I am actually not sure.	0
oh i love kids i know they need help	0
Does Save the Children help children in the United States?	6
I could give 5 more cents but that is all for now.	0
I love helping where I can.	0
I think children deserve all the help they can get.	0
I am a big fan of organizations who take care of the needs of hurt children.	0
Am Great, How about you?	0
I can do $2.00!	0
I will donate .15 from my payment.	0
interesting.	0
I most likely will.	0
Thank you for donating your time to the cause.	0
Most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	0
I appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.	0
115 USD to the charity	0
Yeah I am interested to hear more.	0
Are you interested?	0
I suppose that is true.	0
That's incredible.	0
I know!	0
Sounds like they really help education wise.	0
I am well thank you and you?	0
Thank you for telling me about this organization.	0
hi how are you today	0
I'm good with them doing that.	0
war is like adults acting like children but worse because they know they're not showing regard to the people suffering	0
yes I would be honored to.	0
They sound like an interesting charity.	0
I think that is is awful and sad.	0
How are you today?	0
That's nice.	0
I think everyone kind of forgot that those affected still need help	0
I know it does I'll donate 5 dollars	0
really?	0
I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities.	0
However, that is only salary.	0
How are you?	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
I did actually, but i can't remember the.	0
yes I do, because it is need.	0
I will happily donate 60 cents.	0
Huh, that's awesome.	0
I don't think so, what do they support?	6
Give me your details i will send you later on.	0
I know they are a well established charity so should have all the resources, administration wise, to get the money where it is needed most.	0
Do they have a car?	0
Ok, sounds great!	0
What is the minimum dollar amount?	0
Today is beautiful!!	0
I hear ya!	0
But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.	4
I would like that.	0
That is a good way to think about it.	0
I am one who like to donate.	0
I think they are important; and there are several focusing on distinct issues.	0
Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something.	0
I wish they were way more specific in the instructions on both ends.	0
I think it's very important to donate to charities.	0
We have SO many places to go to for help	0
What country receives the most aid?	6
I have donated on 2017.	0
Can i donate my time instead?	3
Hello	0
I also hate seeing children so helpless.	0
If only all kids were so lucky.	0
Sounds wonderful!	0
I've been following the news about family separations very closely.	0
How do I make sure my money is being used for that purpose?	9
Tell me more info otherwise you can donate to the charities that I know do extraordinary work and spend most of their donations on the children	6
In what ways do they help children?	6
yes! i said that's a fair point.	0
I will.	0
what would you suggest?	2
I tried to give him my food but it was too late	0
My pay?	0
Do you have anything like that?	0
My family would just get through somehow.	0
It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	0
I do think it is a good cause.	0
how long was the charity been run	6
You are welcome.	0
Do they?	0
I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	0
I saw a disheartening bstory on the news about some children that were injured due to that very violence.	0
Not today but I'll definitely save the website for the future.	7
anything helps and It would make me feel better to know that I tried even if it not a big amount, I will donate what I can and continue.	0
How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?	6
This is so true.	0
I recently saw a old movie at the theatre called Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart.	0
I can not believe how warm it is already.	0
There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.	5
However I will donate later.	7
good education and good health	0
I was unaware.	0
Glad to see it goes to shelter, clothing, and food.	0
Thank you for letting me know.	0
ok$1 it is	0
awesome, thank you so much	0
$0.05?	0
No need to share more information	0
there are other charities I'd like to donate to over this one.	3
Yeah, I like the name, I am curious about it, I would like to know some morea about it.	0
If I donate, even a little, I want it to actually go towards what it should, not just lining the pockets of the CEO.	9
I am born and raised in Florida	0
How are you?	0
I am not sure I am just very biased	9
Are you talking about around the world or in the states?	6
Yes, absolutely.	0
Do you know what kind of services they will provide with the money?	6
That is freat!!	0
I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	0
That makes sense.	0
Hey	0
What inspired you to work for Save the Children?	6
How much are you donating?	2
:)I like that it's non-governmental.	0
I also take in children that would other wise go without.	0
Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	0
WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	0
Save the children sounds like a wonderful charity to donate to	0
A friend has been doing it for awhile, and I've always been interested.	0
It was nice speaking with you! :)	0
yes you can	0
I can not imagine food or clothing being a luxury.	0
I'd like to see how the money is dispersed in the company	7
cool, so what can i do	0
That way, you know what the money is being used for.	9
Enjoy the rest of the day.	0
what donations are we talking about?	0
How much do you donate?	2
I think I have heard of it.	0
No, not really.	1
If everyone would just give something, everyone could have food and a warm place to sleep.	2
Nutrition is important	0
I've had similar things happen.	0
I can donate the .30 base payment but I am still very curious on donating outside the HIT.	0
Looking forward chatting with you too.	0
Yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children	0
That is awesome.	0
Yes, I have donated a year before.	0
I have no problem donating the entire $2, and I agree, every bit does help!	0
I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.	0
a few times	0
I donate to charities often and can lose track of what I donate to.	0
It is worldwide or one specific country?	6
Honestly, it should be a choice.	0
thanks.	0
Hello!	0
However, every cent counts.	0
I don't have any experiences like that but I'm sure it must have been very difficult and scary to go through that as a child.	0
I also like to save the children.	0
Wow, that is amazing.	0
I will donate 0.05 cents today.	0
I've never been on an MTurk Hit like this.	0
I wonder sometimes how much of the actual money that gets donated goes to helping people and not into the pockets of those running the charity.	9
Where does the other percentage of donations go?	6
I hope you continue your donations.	0
Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	0
No I didn't know that.	0
Yes.	0
Thank you!	0
It's on my to-do list though.	7
Yes pleas do	0
ok $25 sounds ok	0
who own the charity	6
Well yeah that's why im giving them the dollar?	8
amassing!	0
wow no i did not	0
Are you donating to them?	0
So if i donate will 100% of my donation go to a child?	9
Sure.	0
That sounds like an amazing charity.	0
do you do any volunteer work?	0
What exactly would that 30 cents be used for and how would it help?	6
I hope you have a great day as well!	0
So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	0
No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	0
It's not a huge amount but unfortunately I have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	4
what is the website?	0
I am somewhat familiar with them	0
Are we being selfish by keeping half?	0
Do you have any personal connection with that charity?	0
Yeah it's very important to help someone that is less fortunate than yourself.	0
What does Save the Children do?	6
Yes I would like to make a donation.	0
Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.	3
Hope you have lots of fun at the carnival!	0
Tell me more	0
Ok.	0
i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	0
Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here.	0
That's awful.	0
Can I donate $30 a month?	0
Thank you for introducing me to another great charity that is trying to do good work.	0
I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	0
I'm good,how are you?	0
i have heard about it.	0
Hello there	0
Ill donate $1	0
You seem partial to save the children.	0
I will do that.	0
I'd love to visit one of their facilities.	0
give me some reasons i should donate	6
no i havent	0
Have you ever donated?	2
That seems like a really noble cause.	0
haha.	0
Any organization that helps kids is one worth supporting, either with my own time or with money.	0
And the fact that not much of the donation actually get to the "cause".	9
What is the average donation amount that most donors contribute at one time?	6
I'd be interested in donating to your cause	0
No problem!	0
yes i do	0
yes that would be great i will take a look at it and tell you if i have decided to donate at this time or not	0
they sound like a good charity to donate to	0
How much will you be donating?	0
What specific causes the charity donate to?	6
I am contemplating adoption for the future.	0
Of course, its a great organization to support	0
I know how hard it can be to be healthy, so I want to help kids get the treatments they need.	0
I would be glad to.	0
Do you have any specific country in mind?	0
Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.	0
Do you donate to this cause as well?	0
If so, how much do you give?	0
no its ok i just like children because they need help	0
Horrible, I know.....	0
They should probable do internet promotion.	0
Ethical charities do.	9
That sounds good.	0
I have to make it more than 3 words	0
How does this work?	0
No I don't have any other questions.	0
A lot of charities are just a name and they don't do what they promise.	9
How do they go about providing relief to the children?	6
Good for you!	0
I am interested.	0
I work with my local goverment in policy development and people like you really make a great impression on the policy that is created.	3
I am not going to waste the reward.	1
How do I do that?	0
Does this money that goes for donation stay here in the United States?	6
thank you so much!	0
What is the name of the organization?	0
Yes- the war in Syria had traumatized many children	0
I do have a big family, I enjoy it at times, other times I don't	0
I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	0
Hello, same!	0
What about you?	0
Do you know what these children are suffering from and what the money will be funding?	6
What do you have in mind?	2
I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support.	6
tell me more	6
5$ maybe, plus minus, why?	0
The instructions weren't super clear on my end.	0
what?	0
Nice to meet you as well have a good one :)	0
You are very welcome.	0
Personally, transparency is especially vital.	0
Did you have any worries about food, shelter, safety, etc.?	0
i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.	9
ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries	0
You are so welcome.	0
Okay I will be sure and research the organization to better understand.	7
When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	0
No, I haven't	0
Great what about you?	0
Oh I didn't know that.	0
I've heard of Red Cross	3
How long have you been donating?	0
Hello.	0
You convinced me that it's a worthwhile charity.	0
I think so, it said we need to get to 10 turns of the conversation each, this is my 8th lol	0
i actually did but never had a chance to do so	0
I live in a very rural area, people in my town are extremely poor and it still amazes me how they will take what little they have and take care of each other.	0
Those are very good questions.	0
Nice, I hope it's not too warm this weekend	0
Perfect.	0
They sound like they are a legitimate organization.	0
I will give $0.20	0
I'm glad we good agree on a charity to donate to.	0
I do, too.	0
It's so important that there is a organization looking out for children.	0
I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	7
How long has this group been in operation?	6
So I like to donate $5 to the cause	0
Yes.	0
Thats an awesome labor	0
What made you interested in this charity and not another one?	2
What's their website address?	6
Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	6
that's very cool!	0
I don't believe so.	9
Me 2.	0
What kind of work do they do?	6
Would you prefer to donate clothes, food, money, or something else?	0
okay i will donate $1	0
That's wonderful.	0
Thats good to hear.	0
So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.	3
oh yeah, absolutely!!	0
It does.	0
I would like to know more about this charity	6
That's a whole lot of rice and flour.	0
I will donate 10 cents of my 30 cent payment.	0
What kind of aid do they give?	6
your very welcome	0
I can imagine!	0
Additionally, I am just very skeptical of any organization that asks for money.	9
hello	0
oh how would you help the children	6
You are welcome.	0
Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	0
lol	0
Yes that is a common way.	0
how long has STC been around?	6
Oh, wow!	0
it's going good so far this morning for me.	0
Tell me more.	0
I am lost.	0
And every little bit can add up.	0
Yes.	0
all of it seems a little steep!	0
Thanks.	0
Yes its really appreciated	0
yes sounds great.	0
Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.	0
i feel like i need to do something like that	0
I understand that we will both be donating.	0
How much are you donating?	2
Not very much of a life.	0
It's the reason I go to work everyday.	0
Pennies matter to me.	4
Do you have any info on this children's charity we're supposed to talk about?	6
Definitely a charity that I could stand behind and support.	0
Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.	3
You too	0
I would be okay with donating $0.10 from the task payment towards the charity.	0
How would i go about donating today	0
What exactly do they do?	6
What are some of the things that they do for the children?	6
Warm and rainy here.	0
Yes I am,	0
You are definitely in for warm weather, which is great as far as I am concerned.	0
Yes I have.	0
I would be fine with that.	0
That's wonderful!	0
will you tell me?	6
I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.	0
No but I just copied the link and am going to look at it now.	0
I would really like to help.	0
yes i would	0
Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?	9
They are?	0
Well, I would prefer to hear more about the charity, their work and how much of their donations go to direct work with these children.	6
half would work for me.	0
I am not sure yet. What is their website?	0
Sure I like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others	0
Yes, it sounds like a good charity.	0
Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	0
How do I do that?	0
OF course, it will be great for all around, my daughter to see that she should do things like this out of kindness and for the children , thank you	0
I don't personally I have a niece, and lots of cousins	0
cool i never been how is it??	0
Your perspective is helpful.	0
The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	0
I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.	0
How about 15?	0
I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.	3
That sounds great.	0
I hate to be so prejudicial, but I care about the kids around me more than ones I cannot see!	0
I believe my money should first focus on children in need in this country.	2
How about you?	0
yes i am very much sure.	0
Yeah, a few local charities.	0
I like to learn about an array of different things.	0
How do I donate?	6
save the children sounds like an amazing organization.	0
Oh, that's great!	0
I am sure but I just am not able at this time	4
So glad to help	0
o.k. agreed 1800 dollares done	0
I bet it's especially good around Christmas when people are in the spirit of giving.	0
We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	0
I agree, the local charities are good.	3
That is wonderful!	0
I have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.	0
Well being that im kind of a poor person myself im kind of in the same boat as the children lol.	4
I am okay.	0
I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	0
I would if I could.	0
Ok if you need means you take that amount.	0
I do not have children of my own and am not able to have them.	0
That's nice.	0
What is the purpose of the charity?	6
Ah..	0
I always like to help when I can.	0
One last question - are all members who help volunteer based?	6
Absolutely!	0
Ok that is good to know.	0
i'm happy with that.	0
It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity.	0
That's pretty impressive.	0
I do not wish to donate.	1
Yes most definitely i totally agree with you!	0
I am fine, thanks!	0
Have you ever donated to a children's charity?	0
It's really cool.	0
When was this charity started?	6
well, I can't imagine anyone would much less a child....	0
I would do anything to protect my son	0
Do I what with save the children	0
Perhaps a link to an organization or other agency that rates major charities would be more helpful.	9
Great, thank you!	0
People aren't likely to donate to charities that they know nothing about.	3
So why do they deserve my money as opposed to other charities like St Judes or the Red Cross>	3
I agree that you have to be careful.	0
Shelter?	6
It's heartbreaking!	0
Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	0
I'm not donating to your children's charity.	1
Are you looking for a donation for the charity?	0
I am pretty sure they do.	0
What kind of children's charities do you know about?	6
Is America helping?	6
I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.	0
Like our animal shelter, a low income housing group, foster care organziations, etc	0
I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	2
Sure is sad to see so many children in distress around the world.	0
How much are you giving?	2
I don't know much about their events.	0
I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered.	0
There are always things in my community that I attend and donate as much as I can and donate my time as well at the local Salvation Army.	3
That's true.	0
I could spread out donations.	0
I used to manage a store and we often picked childrens charities to give to.	0
I think about them so often.	0
For today I would like to donate $.30	0
how many employees are there?	6
That is an incredible figure!!!	0
What's it spent on?	6
yes i am.	0
I am unclear as to whether or not this is a real donation or just discussion for the sake of the task	9
Fine how are you?	0
I work with children who have terminal illnesses.	0
North Carolina, I've been to Florida once, it's nice.	0
What was life like for you growing up?	0
I am not willing to donate from my study payment as this money is vital to me.	4
0k Here is a .25	0
No, I have not heard about that charity.	0
That serves a purpose too!	0
Ok, I will consider doing that.	8
That is so heartbreaking.	0
But I"m always willing to help!	0
what other organizations?	5
I will donate 10 cents.	0
Sure!	0
Where is this organization based?	6
Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt.	0
Okay, thank you.	0
Yeah hopefully	0
Of course I am very interested to donate funds to charity	0
I wouldn't have the time off to do that.	0
What do I need to know about them?	0
really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	6
I am sure there are people who need it more than me	0
Oh cool.	0
How much do you think that I should give?	0
Is it a non profit?	6
Boy and girl.	0
Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.	0
Very well, thank you.	0
i would donate	0
Do you know if the donations that we are making are tax deductible?	0
Hey, I am fine!!	0
I agree, Save the children foundation work with the children through out their lives to make sure they grow up in a safe environment and get a chance to succeed based on their website.	0
Though MTurk they should raise quite a bit.	0
I heard that, with some organizations, only 10% of the money goes to the recipient!	0
What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	0
hello i would like to help too even its a bit	0
As in my weekly paycheck?	0
I wanted to help and want to help with a donation	0
You are welcome; anything for the children I say!	0
Yea, I think thats most important.	0
I can not donate until 10 chat turns.	0
Yeah lol	0
I think I would be able to donate some of my earnings.	0
What about you?	2
yes my home in 3 childrens i take for in the life	0
i have not, can you tell me more?	6
Ok - so can I donate $20?	0
How can I donate and how much?	0
Great!	0
I work hard to help children as well.	0
I do like the satisfaction of doing good work for and towards others.	0
I think it's a great chairty.	0
Ok, that sounds good.	0
We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations	0
I would like to donate.	0
I then can see the money at work.	3
What is my payment for this task?	0
You as well.	0
I still haven't decided for sure though.	8
Of course im hear to listen .	0
Hello	0
Hello, what do the Save the Children Federation do?	6
They help a lot of city kids.	0
I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	0
Is it a charity that you are interested in?	0
I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people	3
Ronald McDonald House is the name I think.	0
People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.	2
charity is a bad for that.	9
I wonder how much their CEO makes for saving the children.	4
I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities.	0
I have!	0
ANything else I should know about this charity?	6
ok, I'll do $1 but I want to know your mturk worker ID to prove it's a person	0
How about you do you have a favorite charity?	0
i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	0
I'd like to donate 5 dollar	0
(1, o.k. let's say 1600 dollares total, o.k.?	0
I cuddle babies in the NICU.	3
Yes, of course.	0
I think I might donate mine too!	8
Unfortunately, I cant do that.	1
It was nice chatting with you.	0
would donating one penny help	0
How much of a donation would one have to make to feed a family for a week?	0
why you laugh.	0
Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?	0
Tell me more.	0
I am just very concerned for the children.	0
Do they need clothes as well?	6
Please be specific about how it will help these children that save the children claims to be saving?	6
Thank you for your guidance.	0
I don't know if I'd necessarily feel comfortable donating.	8
Yes I do, you've really inspired me Tommy	0
I just can't see doing that.	1
Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	0
That's the goal, for sure.	0
Thanks, you too.	0
How do you raise donations?	0
Similiar, I only donate when I have the money to spare.	0
Would you give some of that .15 to Ronald McDonald?	2
I am doing well.	0
It is really sad that Save a Child exists, the world should be a safe place for children and there should be no need.	0
I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.	3
Yes that is correct	1
How can i help?	0
How do i know if it's a legit organization	9
Sure, what amount is a smaller pledge?	0
That is amazing.	0
Yes, I just want to make sure that you read properly that I'm giving 0.1 not 0.01.	0
oh thats very easy then	0
Does it come from our reward/bonuses?	0
Thank you for telling me about this charity	0
Do they provide legal help or support to live?	6
Much better.	0
Agreed.	0
I was just about to mention that I never really have donated to any organization.	0
Does it help children in this country or in another country?	6
What is the organization called?	0
you're right, it is non-profit organisation.	0
That is absolutely terrible.	0
There were periods in my childhood when money was very short and we had our telephone or power cut off, but I always had a safe place to live and food to eat.	0
Yes.	0
the operation has risks	5
i would donate some clothes and some toys for children	0
You are welcome.	0
I'm good, how are you doing?	0
Generous?	0
thank you and hope it helps	0
This allows doctors to go to other countries?	6
Sounds like a blessed organization.	0
where are you	0
Doing Good.	0
i think i will donate one cent.	0
My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.	0
I guess they save children	0
I have been following politics and things are going crazy.	0
I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.	0
Do you know how someone can get involved?	6
you too!!!!! :D	0
Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	6
Which countries do they work in?	6
You?	0
I think you are a wonderful person.	0
How involved are you in the organization?	0
hi	0
I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.	4
I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.	9
Fine, thank you.	0
Oh that is really nice.	0
no	0
What are they about?	6
I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	0
How much am I allowed to donate?	0
That would be alright.	0
It is the least I can do for him.	0
I'd like more information, yes.	0
That is all i can afford	0
Have you ever sponsored a child?	2
It was my pleasure	0
I think I have heard of it.	0
How do they ensure that the money is effective in feeding the children and not lining pockets?	9
you are very welcome!	0
not my time anymore no...too busy	0
ok, got it.	0
even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	6
Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	0
I'm proud of us.	0
I know its not much.	0
How you doin	0
actually i have a kid that is sick and overseas right now	0
Wow .	0
How can I donate?	0
What specific countries do they help out?	6
Wow that is wonderful.	0
They do lots of TV adverts.	0
Thank you for the information.	0
Ok i will donate some	0
I don't	0
Is this a legit charity?	9
I heard that some bad weather was going to be coming.	0
Hi there.	0
How old are they?	0
Children are our future.	0
I wouldb but I don't have any money right now.	4
Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	7
We should donate money then.	0
I do like but have not volunteered them, but if i get a chance i try to do	0
That\'s the only reason I\'m still here.	0
I agree.	0
What organizations do you donate to?	2
I don't have much. How about .25?	0
I would like more information to be sent to me so I could look into it	8
hi	0
how are you today?	0
I'm sure Save the Children helps them?	0
Do I need to do anything else to make sure I get the money donated?	0
What do you think I should donate?	0
That would be so sweet of them.	0
Can you tell me about it?	6
Yes, it is a worthy organization and I do believe that it helps in many substantial ways.	0
Most people wouldn't give anything and it makes me really happy to meet someone that would help with whatever they can.	0
I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	9
I think I'd be willing to donate about 25 cents	0
I have to respectfully question the necessity -- don't my taxes already go towards billions of dollars of foreign aid?	2
How much will you be planning on donating to the charity?	2
I couldn't agree more.	0
I am sure they do.	0
where do you came from?	0
yes that is	0
I agree.	0
$0.25 is a good amount	0
It was pretty good, hot weather but still nice and yours?	0
that is a good approach, i have been doing some research on charities	0
I think it would really help them out	0
yeah i know how donation works.	0
How can I help?	0
I can't decide which onne.	0
Yes, I have.	0
Oh that's great!!	0
Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	0
as of now i am donating $1	0
Ah ok very nice.	0
At this time I can't donate any amount.	1
I'm not - Could you tell me more about it?	6
I would if I had at least $200 in my bank account.	4
I am not aware of that.	0
There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	0
Hi	0
I will have to take a look at the website.	7
They do an awesome labor	0
I am an old retired guy with limited income.	4
hi,it was another day	0
I understand that.	0
i'm super broke right now	4
I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.	9
Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	2
I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	7
I would like to donate	0
I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs.	0
yes.i am sure you can do more.there might be things you can cut from your budget	0
I don't trust the bigger charities.	9
i don' known it detailly	0
I am doing fine, thanks for asking.	0
no, I do not wish to donate at this time.	1
So we are supposed to chat about a children's charity.	0
It's sometimes hard to focus	0
Wow, that is so good to hear.	0
How do I donate?	0
I would be willing to donate my time and perhaps some money.	0
Is this charity local?	6
I feel very bad for the children in Syria.	0
I agree, how frequently do you donate?	0
I appreciate your position, but what exactly is Save the Children and how do I know that money will truly be used to help kids?	6
Possibly, I'm not sure.	7
Well, I don't have much money right now.	4
It's good to be able to help someone else out and have it be easy and painless.	0
Hm, it depends on my schedule to be honest because I still have to pay rent and I don't have set hours but I'd be willing to give around $100 if I have solid hours every month.	4
What countries has the charity worked in recently?	6
Have you donated to this organization?	2
Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.	0
Nope.	0
well if you aren't going to help me out with information and make it easy on me by helping with info, i'm not sure if you really care	2
do they take donations	9
No problem.	0
Good morning!	0
What encourages you to donate monthly	0
i didnt know till now , you verified what i heard , they are making something beautiful for the people of Hawaii .	0
I'm still not sure.	8
how can i contact them	0
I think that we take many things for granted such as running water, and always having food on the table.	0
OK.	0
Hi how are you doing today?	0
thank you sir.	0
it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.	0
Is this okay?	0
That's so sad.	0
I hope the money donated goes directly to them and not in the pockets of those running the organization.	0
No, i haven't actually.	0
I really need the money that i'm earning for this task, so I feel like giving 10 cents to this charity is fair.	0
Is there another way to donate?/	0
I think it is the least I could do.	0
im happy to help	0
Good luck with your charity	0
a little, what do they do?	6
I didn't realize that.	0
I have seen a lot of people do the same.	0
Well that is good.	0
it makes me good	0
It sounds like a great charity.	0
that is very sad.	0
Yes, I would like to hear more.	0
And you?	0
Yes, I agree.	0
No problem.	0
well I have to go to work in a little while here how about you?	0
I'm fine how are you.	0
How much would you donate?	2
I would like to donate $10 right now.	0
Do you know anything about how they are helping the children?	6
That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	0
I am good.	0
Simple Google search.	0
okey.	0
Interesting.	0
I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	0
It really breaks my heart. I wish I could help everyone in need.	0
I typically give to local charities that use the funds to help in the community.	3
How would you go about donating to this cause?	9
Nope.	0
What types of things are being done to help the children in Syria?	6
I too would consider doing it	0
I have kids here that need help first	2
Yes, I also like what they do.	0
I would like to to donate $1.00 as a mturk worker	0
sorry but not now.	1
yes.	0
I'm sure they do a lot of nice work.	0
yes, fifteen cents	0
I have a very rudimentary understanding.	0
Lets leave it at that.	0
I'm really sorry.	0
Me too, if only we could help!	0
I would.	0
Okay.	0
I do not want to make a donation today.	1
I don't know much about that charity all all.	0
Yes, I try to help time to time	0
Am so glad to hear that	0
Sure thing.	0
Yes, I would be happy to!	0
Have they raised a lot so far?	0
I wish they can help even more countries	0
powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	2
So I would definitely be willing to help.	0
Have a great week	0
Thank you.	0
what was the procedure	0
It hurts my heart when I see those children's charity commercials.	0
Hello!	0
You're very welcome.	0
it depends.	0
Ditto to you.	0
Do nothing about what?	6
I've done that before on other tasks.	0
we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	0
yes I know	0
Do you believe they don't?	0
Really?	0
I do not have any children yet.	0
What about you?	2
ya fine morning what about you	0
I hope that is adequate and helps them for food and shelter.	0
That is very impressive.	0
So if this just for children in America?	6
Go for it.	0
Thank you and I do not want to be rude but I am straight talking person	0
oh ok then $50	0
I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	7
Yes anything I can do to help.	0
Thank you for your time, and for the opportunity.	0
Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	0
Well, I already donae to other charities so I'm not sure.	3
Alright that's cool so how does this charity take its donations.	6
Well the have a great cause.	0
yes, in fact ill most likely give ten thousand	5
Yes.	0
Thanks for telling me about it.	0
I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	0
I'm good how about you?	0
Very true!	0
I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	0
okay..and how are you	0
you are welcome	0
I like the fact that it's an international organization.	0
Have a great day.	0
I'm sorry	0
You sure can	0
how they managing in 120 countries?	6
Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	7
Yes, I do.	0
So lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus.	0
Makes sense you gotta keep the engine running.	0
I think I'd like to donate 0.05	0
SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.	0
where is this organization based?	6
Thank you!	0
I already help an organization but would be glad to help another one too.	3
It is so sad.	0
I know of many that I do not support due to the 6 figure salaries of the CEO.	9
Alright I will ask my co-workers	0
I would love to do that.	0
The donations to heal and help with health issues is very crucial	0
I can't donate less than 0.50?	5
What do they do?	6
It sounds like a good charity.	0
I am well.	0
I forgot to ask, how is the weather by you today?	0
I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	0
That sounds like a great idea!	0
Is there any other information you can share with me that I shuld know about?	6
Where does the other 10 cents go then?...and I guess it's a good thing I decided to give them that dollar then =)	9
I did not.	0
after i die i will donate my all..	4
can't complain, youreslf?	0
I do have a soft spot for children.	0
all children's using in the children's charity.. and all peoples join in the children's charity....	0
I agree.	0
Are you thinking of donating to it?	2
Sorry, no.	1
That would work best for me.	0
Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	0
That's awesome!	0
I don't think I'm quite ready to decide yet though.	8
I don't think i've heard of that.	0
Hmm, I would like to, but I'm having some financial trouble at the moment.	4
it is very happy day	0
We have a school here in my small town for children from broken homes.	3
$0.10-Can you see this?	0
Is there a minimum i can donate?	0
It is great to be a helpful person.	0
I am good.	0
Not really, please tell me anything!	6
I not sure, how many children are in need of a donation?	6
OK sounds good.	0
thanks, same to you.	0
If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	0
I think so!	0
Well I hope that my $1.10 helps those poor children and when i dont need to rely on HITs for money i'd love to donate more.	0
Thank you Glad I was able to helpthis organization with my donation	0
I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.	9
good charity.	0
No, please tell me more.	6
thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	0
I do want to help in anyway that I can.	0
oh wow ok how much do you suggest?	0
What is the charity?	0
Yea, hello.	0
There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.	9
I just do not have the funds available.	1
Be the change you want to see in the world, right?	0
Hi, Yes I am	0
I will also tell others about this charity.	0
work here is the other thing, my donation comes from my other payment	7
As long as my donation gets to the children, I will donate to the charity	0
Which charity would that be?	0
can I confirm that you would also like to donate 5% of yours?	0
That really wouldn't bother me at all.	3
Oh i bet. I would love to hear stories about the children that have been saved	0
Do I get anything for donating?	0
Not even a little!	0
I would possibly be interested!	0
how much will you donate	0
Yeah, I can do that.	0
I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	0
A one time donation would be best.	3
I do not do this "only" for the money, but to try and help any way I can.	0
I'm not sure how this donation process will work, do you know the specifics?	9
ok thats great.	0
I think our must move cautiously to deal with this country.	0
Great job!	0
I'm not sure I understand what you said just now.	0
I don't have any children but there are many children in my family.	0
yes I've donated $ 150 to this year for this organization	0
I am thinking I only want to donate .10	0
How long has this charity been in existence?	6
What is the easier way?	0
I can do that	0
Oh that is interesting.	0
Absolutely!	0
Ok, how about $0.30?	0
In Africia, Asia, etc.	6
Are you thinking of donating to it?	2
I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.	0
I hope so.	0
Hi, how are you?	0
hi	0
I think I will donate to them today too.	0
In what way does it support children?	6
I enjoyed this.	0
yes i education help for the children.	0
So it looks like the money goes toward health and education?	6
It depends, should this be a monthly donation or annual?	6
I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	0
Yes children should have access to healthcare and basics needs	0
Hmm, I see.	0
The explanations you provided were very useful.	0
I am curious what we can do to help.	0
Right, it will probably have to be 80% of my task payment then.	0
Glad to help.	0
Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	0
I propose we stick with our half plan.	0
very good to do	0
I think Disney World participates too.	0
Unfortunately some "charities" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.	9
Are any fund going to help the the children in Hawaii after the volcano and hurricane?	6
Yea...I am also feel bad that incident...	0
i mostly deal with friend and other persons	0
Yes I know.	0
Even though it is only .30 for this hit, with the number of people it adds up.	0
I've been given no info about the charity.	3
Yes I have in the past, but not recently	0
Ugh that is rough..Nobody deserves that in this world	0
Darn really gonna make me miss out on that bad of chips huh?...lol how about $1.15 and you have yourself a deal...	4
Sounds like they accomplish great things.	0
We could either donate money or our time.	0
I will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.	0
Have a nice day!	0
That is good.	0
Yes, definitely.	0
Could you explain to me what the 25$ will go to exactly, is it for building houses, farms, shelters,...	9
I tend to read news articles from aboard. BBC, ect.	0
Can you tell me more about it?	6
Lol.I'm not a bot......	0
thank you very much	0
Wow, that's amazing.	0
Donating part of a purchase is such an easy way for a large amount of people to donate money.	0
I have a sister who is under eighteen.	0
aw, really ?	0
Any organization who promotes rights for those who don't have the platform to speak up is a wonderful charity.	0
This company looks more like a firm than a charity	9
Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	6
it says a child's charity.	0
I did not know that.	0
Hello, how are you today?	0
And you?	0
I could certainly ask some of my coworkers and tell them about the match if they donate at least $500 and tell them what a worthy cause it is.	0
I could probably donate a small amount.	8
WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	0
can i direct my money?	0
So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?	0
What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	6
so i like that 86% is going to the cause.	0
It depends on the charity!	0
All we could do is our part since problem is so big.	0
No.	0
No problem.	0
Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	0
I am doing fine.	0
I've lived for 76 years and have only experienced two reasonably good presidents.	5
No, I have not.	0
Fine...what about you..?	0
That is very interesting.	0
No thank you.	1
I do agree 100%How would I go about finding this charity?	0
That is impressive.	0
What are they?	0
Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.	0
Yes I have, but I don't know a lot about it.	0
How exactly does it support children in developing countries?	6
It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	0
I do not understand.	0
Can you?	0
That would be fine.	0
It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country	5
I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	0
That would be fine with me.	0
Thank you. You too	0
Hi...	0
How long has this charity been around?	6
I agree!	0
I do too	0
Where is the charity based out of?	6
What would benefit me towards donating my $2 to the Save the Children fund?	0
Doing good.	0
Hi!	0
How much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?	0
I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.	0
What would donating like that help inform me on the charity?	0
I can't imagine how terrible it must be for a child to grow up inside a war zone.	0
Cool no problem	0
then is there any think special about it	0
How has "Save the Children" helped to aid in health, education and safety of the Syrian children?	6
Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	0
I am glad I can help in anyway that I can.	0
we can see our happiness on other faces while helping for them	0
Oh, really?	0
But private donations certainly help.	0
I would like to give 100% of the task payment.	0
if there isn't coverage then people tend put it out of their minds.	0
I don't mind helping those abroad.	0
I agree.	0
Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	0
It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.	0
We still have chat a bit more.	0
I think I have.	0
Do you know where I can go to donate?	0
I only like to donate to reputable organizations, I am familiar with save the children, they often advertise.	3
I have been doing some research while waiting for your responses.	0
Just to confirm, I'm donating 80% of my task amount.	0
No problem!	0
Thank you for your generosity!	0
That's wonderful!	0
I think there are a lot of safeguards in organizations like this one that is set up to prevent such a thing.	0
nope 1 is cool	0
Yes, I've heard of it.	0
I can give $0.60 cents.	0
credit card? cash?	0
i will donate more than $100	0
like a quarter here and a quarter there.	0
Yes I would	0
How do we know that our donation is reaching those in need?	9
That is amazing!!!	0
Oh that's great.	0
Oh that's great and makes me feel better!	0
it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.	9
Sounds good to me.	0
Yes, I'm interested.	0
That is something I do not think about.	0
Awesome!	0
Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	0
That sounds like a good organization.	0
Yes, I like to help whenever I can when it comes to children.	0
I admire your effort reaching to people to help the charity.	0
Sure, I will donate 50 cents to them.	0
that is so sad	0
It is sad.	0
Thats sad so many children were killes	0
Nice!	0
There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	9
I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	0
Just in my country (United States)?	6
I don't have a lot of income to donate to charity :(	4
If I'm in the right place at the right time or am given an opportunity.	0
Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	0
you have been great.	0
I will donate the $2 towards the Save the Children fund.	0
I'm doing well, thanks!	0
Is this primarily in African and South America?	6
You could also mention their rating from the BBB.	0
I think charities would recieve a lot more if the country would go after the 1% to help	0
i do very much yes	0
How are you doing?	0
Againwhatroughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	6
Is this the same group where people used to "sponsor" a child?	6
What is the one thing you would say to someone to encourage a donation?	6
I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	0
Mostly working on surveys	0
Sure.	0
do you donate often?	0
I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	0
I will look in to donating my time locally, thank you!	7
oh ok I'm sorry I have read wrong, if I would be willing to donate with pleasure is a good cause	0
I think that's great!	0
There are thousands that need help	2
Sounds good.	0
ok are we to decide annamount?	0
good morning too and am also same as your location	0
Hello, yes I have but I am not sure what the charity works towards	6
However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	2
You are welcome.	0
O I have heard of Save the children.	0
What does it help the children with?	6
Iwork in an office setting as well, I guess we are to talk about childrens charity's.	0
oh yep thats really good	0
I will gladly .	0
ha, that is much better.	0
I would be willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cent payment to help save children.	0
How long have you worked there?	0
no i am okay with this amount	0
oh ok thats fine	0
That way nobody can question anything.	0
ok cool is there a website?	6
What do you mean you have gotten to save $100,You are saying it isn't a non profit?	6
Hi, I currently have a children's charity that I sponsor	0
Yes I know that organization.	0
Yeah, you're welcome.	0
I would have donate a smaller amount.	0
I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	0
Yeah totally agreed.	0
Which is why i trust them.	3
I do.	0
I would possibly be interested in that.	0
The way things are going I don't expect to experience any thing close to that again.	5
That sounds great!	0
Have you ever made a donation to them?	0
Do you make donations on line or mail it in?	0
well, I've already promised 10.	0
Exactly.	0
Go ahead and tell me how can I help	0
I know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages.	9
Wow that is a lot of options.	0
But, I choose my own charities independently.	3
Only in name.	0
So nice job.	0
I think I would be willing to donate a portion.	0
Yes, I would be willing to donate a small portion as well.	0
I dont know much about this charity....what else can you tell me about it	6
Yeah I think its good to help any little bit you can.	0
Wonderful.	0
Yes.	0
Nice talking to you as well.	0
Yes I have, I think they are from the UK.	0
There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.	9
sure can you send it to me	0
you're welcome, that was fun	0
good	0
I was born in USSR and we had very limited resources.	4
Have a good day!	0
What is it about?	6
I guess I would look them up sometime to find out more.	7
What is their website?	6
Is it a global charity?	6
is this a religous charity?	6
I am so sorry to hear about the little guy and how his birthday, too.	0
I would definitely like to make a donation!	0
They are the most vulnerable in society.	0
I think it's 10 exchanges	0
Yes those children need	0
I'll give 5 cents.	0
That's amazing.	0
Yes I would.	0
ok that would be fine	0
I would like to make a donation	0
Do you regularly donate your time or money to Save the Children?	0
Where is the charity located?	6
I may donate something!!	0
That's great!	0
Is there like, an average donation or something?	0
No, but i will definitely donate within next two months	7
I think it's great and I love that they help kids to reunite with their families.	0
So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.	0
wow that sounds like a problem	0
I don't understand what you mean	0
save the children is a good choice.	0
Is there anyway that I can be guaranteed the money will go towards what is promised?	6
Hi!	0
I'm not doing half I'm doing a third.	0
ok great im in	0
That is amazing.	0
I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world	9
It's cloudy a lot, but otherwise fine.	0
Well, it's been nice talking to you.	0
But I have money that I can donate.	0
I think it was from Save The Children.	0
Specially kids in need.There are some living in very bad conditions	0
What kind of camera do you have?	0
Without the funding, it would not be able to continue and without volunteers, no one can do the actual work.	0
Did you ever use the services of any organizations for children to help you through the rough times?	0
I see no reason not to help this charity.	0
Is the charity international?	6
Oh that is really a great idea.	0
Fine.	0
How did Save the Children help?	0
And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?	9
that is not bad I could probably do that.	0
It sure does.	0
nice!	0
oh, I didn't know that I just assumed if we reached an agreement before that they would let us advance.	0
I'd rather give to Ronald McDonalds especially since I know people who have personally benefited.	9
I do not, can you tell me some?	6
How are they rated as a charity?	6
Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	6
oh wow, that sounds important	0
I would be interested in making a donation	0
We will donate today.	0
Many countries have absorbed many refugees and I am fairly certain that way more aid than tents has been provided.	2
I know a little bit.	0
If did they amount was 0..	0
I'm afraid for me, their reputation is still bad.	9
Is ther any other charities you're fond of?	3
I have an affinity for children.	0
I was glad to hear that.	0
I agree with you.	0
It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	5
I am curious if I can state if money goes to children in this country though?	0
Sorry I can't donate more :(	0
Do you have kids?	0
And you likewise to ask.	0
I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.	0
Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	0
They definitely do.	0
Thank you For being able to be so kind hearted as well hope u have a great day and keep a smile on your face ;)	0
I'm not sure yet, maybe 5 cents	0
No, I can't say I have.	0
What countries do they work in?	6
Well, that's a noble cause don't you think	0
I know, it always amazes me how many children are suffering around the world.	0
Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	0
That is all your opinion.	5
OK I will educate myself on them when we are done with our conversation.	7
Save the children	3
What is their mission?	6
to not be able to eat, or drink, and worry about being sick all the time	0
Ok, sounds good.	0
Yes, it will be nice to know that I was able to give to them.	0
I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	0
If I have a chance to donate when I'm a bit more financially stable, I will donate more.	7
Do you know what percentage of donations goes directly to programs (as opposed to overhead costs, salaries, and expenses)?	6
Hey, kind of tired but overall good.	0
would be happy to donate.	0
What are the amounts to donate?	0
That is something I could really get behind.	0
definitely.	0
I think I will donate about 20 dollars.	0
I would consider it.	0
no i havent	0
Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything.	0
Thank you.	0
Absolutely.	0
I hope those kids get the money they need.	0
How are you?	0
What are my options for donation?	0
I am doing good and you?	0
are you involved with charity	6
I don't think so.	0
I would consider donating $0.50.	0
no i dont	0
I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!	0
That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	6
What do they do to help children?	6
yes definitly i am donate in save the children	0
Most of all save the children is a trustworthy organization which I trust to put my donations in with.	0
Yes I have	0
So how did you decide what was right for you?	0
Lets do $1.00 for now but I am glad you have made me aware of an organization that I can look into in order to help others.	0
I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	3
I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	0
So do I, I feel kind of guilty to being able to have all that and they are kids out there who don't have not a single one of all of those basic things	0
what about you?	0
oh yeah and how much would you help them	0
I never know who is in charge, who is taking what, and where the money truly goes.	9
What is my payment?	0
Yes, but I don't know a lot about them.	0
Ok, thank you so much for your help.	0
Wow, I can't even fathom feeling starved as a child or experiencing violence at a young age (outside of television/video games).	0
It sounds like it.	0
goodnight!	0
Really gets the public's interest.	0
What kind of payments do you take?	0
Right, nice chatting with you.	0
I honestly had no idea.	7
I feel that using money to but food directly in their cities is best.	3
I know the children are very grateful!	0
Jude's Hospital In Memphis, TN is an amazing children's charity	0
Like a newsletter?	0
if I would agree with that, and if my organ donated what problems would my body have?	5
I think I'm okay.	0
How are you?	0
I kind of saw some stuff about them on the news.	0
I always prefer going through organizations I have researched to make sure they're reputable as well	3
I have as well.	0
Me too.	0
If I donate $25, does that go a long way?	0
I'm surprised i've never heard about it! how do i know if it's legit and if money really go to help those kids	9
I have a soft spot for children in general.	0
yes i would like to	0
I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.	0
Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence	0
OK, i have donated to them before!!	0
I have but I can't say I am very familiar with what they do.	0
Whatever my task payment will be.	0
How transparent are they about uses of their funds?	6
Why are you talking about this charity instead of the others?	2
Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	6
New York, how about yourself?	0
Wow.	0
Alright, I will donate $1.25, it seems reasonable.	0
Are you going to donate also?	0
To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.	0
What are your donations used for?	6
some got to prison.	9
I do sometimes whe I have extra money	3
Or do you also volunteer your time?	2
Do the donations actually help the organization?	6
Right.	0
i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	0
I will look into it for sure and make a donation.	0
whether to donate or not	0
Time and money donations are really two important aspects for charities.	0
Is that the organization that is helping single parents obtain support from absent parents?	6
We could donate our earnings from this hit and still make a nickel for kibble.	0
I am so glad to hear that!	0
i have not tell me about them	6
I will are you going to help	0
yes, I can do that.....	0
What have they done in the past?	6
I have heard about it.	0
That is correct.	0
I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	0
I've heard good things about Save the Children.	0
thank you!	0
what is save the children	6
So you dont actually know how they use the koney?	9
How exactly does the money help the cause?	6
Oh, thanks for the website, I am sure that it has a lot of information that I could use to learn more about it.	0
That's right, thanks for showing me the page, I will help many children, today I want to sponsor 3	0
What do they do?	0
I trust you.	0
that is very true.	0
So children's charity then...	0
It is in fact 10 or 5% of my weekly income.	0
I don't make a lot.	4
I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.	0
Perhaps I could help out a little.	0
What is the womens name that founded it?	6
yes i sure will do donate.	0
It was really nice chatting with you.	0
ok I support that	0
I don't believe they can actually do that haha	0
I am sceptical of many of them but if you recommend Save The Children and I know that St Judd's is trustworthy, then that's where my money will go today	0
What did you get him?	6
That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	0
of course, especially poor children	0
yes of course!	0
What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses	6
That sounds pretty good.	0
That is terrible.	0
I agree.	0
this is a perfect charity organization , they do all kind of things to help others around the world.	0
I can imagine, that is horrible.....	0
I was just looking through the morning mail.	0
Me too.	0
Thats horrible.. Is this recent?	6
Or do you donate to other ones also?	2
he was in the end i think, this is the kind of things i have about our civilization , many dnt have to eat and many waste their food, its not right	0
Does this charity help children in the United States, or do they deal mostly with children in African nations?	6
Yes, I do.	0
Oh, in answer to your first question I have not done a task like this before.	0
Yea..It's nice too hear....	0
Same to you!	0
I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	9
i do not but hope to some day.	0
Oh, mine just says "children\'s charity" but does not mention any specifics.	0
How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.	0
It's not much, but I don't have much money.	4
yes, i am interested but now not join in children's charity.	0
$35,000,000,000.00	0
It is going alright, thanks	0
I realize that	0
Yes, I am sure.	0
No, I am not very familiar with that charity.	6
helping children without parents is the most altruistic thing we can do	0
Through internet ads?	6
I feel that donating is an ethical reason to give your tithes and offerings	0
I do what I can to give back.	0
Okay.	0
It is very kind of you.Please spread the word on your family and friends	0
It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.	0
I've been working really hard to save every dollar that I can to make sure I can pay my bills.	4
I would like to donate $0.30 today.	0
I did not have to worry about those things.	0
I have donated 15 years of my life to charity	3
I am thinking about it.	8
Do you have any more information about it?	6
Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	0
I never heard of them before today, have you?	0
Where does the other money go?	6
Yeah, totally.	0
I usually like to donate to more local charities, this way it seems safer to actually go where it is needed and it is for poor homeless kids around my own area	3
Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	0
please ur nice name?	0
I don't really have anything to give right now, but I will donate at another time when I have steady income.	7
I really appreciate your willingness to go out on a limb.	0
Can you please explain more about it?	6
I don't have a lot to work with either.	3
How can you assure me?	0
Important to make sure their basic needs are met too -- food, clothing and shelter	0
what will you do with this money.	6
i hope the same for you also!	0
I understand that but how much does the charity keep in order to keep the charity running	6
Man, the site sounds good.	0
Sad but true.	0
I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the moneyis going to where they say it will.	0
Oh yeah, I donate to world vision, its the best for kids	3
So you think they do some actual good?	0
If more people gave, even it's a small amount, it truly adds up and can make a difference.	0
you too.	0
i will like to know about the opportunity first	6
Ive had a few of the charity HITs.	3
I accept your view and it is necessary that everyone should contribute at least to some extent to children's charity	0
very good today, just turking	0
I'm just waiting until it's time to go volunteer at a local children's hospital...	3
how much % of the money that goes to the charity is overhead that will be absorbed and not given to children?	6
How do I make the donation?	6
I typically give to them.	3
No thanks.	1
I assume save the children would be able helping children in three world countries.	0
Hi there how are you?	0
I also tutored kids at a battered woman's shelter.	0
I love children and think it's incredibly important to help ensure they are educated, in safe conditions and are healthy.	0
I happy to help them.	0
that's good to hear.	0
What is their goal?	6
Let's save the children together!	0
Do you only work in the US?	6
I am well, how are you?	0
It sounds like a meaningful charity.	0
I didn't really do that much last week, but it was still relaxing.	0
I would like to donate 5 dollars.	0
I do what I can in my own community and the town comes together this time of year to make sure each child has school supplies.	0
How do you know that they are effective?	9
Awesome, I'll head over there right now and support it thank you.	0
How long have they been around?	6
nice i like this group for many children save in the world	0
What do they do?	6
Not Today but surely ASAP	7
I don't currently, I have donated to an animal shelter a few months ago however.	0
It depends on the way they see it.	0
How do people donate to the charity?	0
Wow that's a really great rating!	0
They sometimes don't put the money that is donated into the right projects.	9
What are the amounts I can pick from?	0
Good, thanks!	0
How can I get involved?	0
Same.	0
I hope you get lots of donations.	0
The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	0
Yes it is.	0
Do you regularly try to help the organization yourself?	2
I really can't do much, but I'd be glad to put down a dollar	0
Same to you!	0
I would, I usually donate some portion of my winnings when it's a children's charity.	0
Thanks.	0
thank you for the information, I think I am ready to donate	0
Can you tell me about it?	6
Sorry	1
I completely agree!	0
But I do agree with the points you made in support.	0
I feel like it's a shame and I wish we could do more.	0
Good just another Monday how about yourself?	0
I know more or less how it works and my goals are, but what do you know	6
That makes sense.	0
I think it is a genuine organization who uses it's fundraising donations in the right way.	0
Well that seems better than some I have read about.	0
You are pretty awesome yourself!	0
Yes I have 2	0
It was nice chatting with you too	0
And what do you do at the organization?	6
i have three kids.	0
How are you?	0
I'll give .50 if you send are actually an mturk human.	0
i can donate 5 if you truly are donating 5.	0
Yes I am interested.	0
How much you ready to pay for children?	0
Yes it is good to try and help in any way possible	0
You're making this take far too long!.	5
I think the charity sounds pretty good.	0
I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.	1
For now, I'm happy with my current donation but maybe another time	7
I totally agree.	0
yes i am.	0
Hang on though.	0
Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?	0
Is it world wide.	6
no this one time is good, thanks	0
I may want to volunteer my time as well instead of just money.	0
this is true.	0
I am ready to donate today and would like to know an acceptable donation.	0
Sounds great. Is there are reason that you have chosen to raise money for Save the Children?	0
Americans pay more for poorer outcomes, compared to peer countries.	0
yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause	0
My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	5
Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.	5
Could you tell me about it?	0
Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	0
I think I could donate $5.00.	0
Well, is this a lobal charity that will be using my money to spread across their whole organization or will it help buy these children new schools which is a cause that I am really passionate about?	6
That is great!	0
I am not sure I know what Save the Children is.	0
That is good information.	0
The violence in Syria is one of the saddest things happening in the world today, as far as I know.	0
So are we agreeing to send $5 to save the children?	0
Yes I will donate	0
Yes I would be willing to donate.	0
Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.	0
i understad you	0
That sounds really great.	0
Have a great day!	0
I think I would donated to donate .50	0
Iit is so imporantant for them	0
Ok that sounds easy enough.	0
looking at the link you provided, it appears that children in America also benefit from Save the Children donations.	0
just not sure i'm willing to donate 0.50 cents	1
I would like to dotate $0.20.	0
yes..i am very familiar..	0
yes I can donate.	0
that is very good to know	0
I think it's time to take a walk a little later!	0
I donate to many local charities in my city.	0
But I don't have money to donate.	4
Oh absolutely!	0
Okay.	0
however there are lots of kids in my ocuntry that need help first	2
It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money.	9
Some don't give the money out like they are suppose to.	2
Before I can donate I will need to know how this organization has help.	8
What types of programs do they offer?	6
I probably will do that.	0
So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	0
give me a minute , let me see	7
they really doing a great job..	0
What is the best organizations and charities for children?	0
I am excited to know we can help out a children's charity.	0
Do you have any kids?	0
What kind of situations do they work with?	6
Ok, you too.	0
Hey, before I forget, I did not tell you about the weather here.	0
I believe its a Christian organization.	0
Thank you so much!	0
I would choose 0 in this instance	0
Yes, and it all adds up at the end of the month especially when you're also struggling to make ends meet.	0
No, I didn't either.	0
If I have anything it will go to homeless shelters, food pantries and environmental causes.	3
go ahead :)	0
yes, I will do it	0
That is cool that you lived in three different states.	0
Sure.	0
How are you?	0
Hello how are	0
Are there any charities that work in that area?	6
That is awesome.	0
I would like to donate $5 monthly.	0
What do you do for Save the Children?	0
Is there a website for this charity?	6
Thank you very much!	0
Have a wonderful day.	0
Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.	0
I always like to give a small donation of some kind and always believe that others should also.	0
Are you a cubs fan?	0
Yes, I would love some information.	0
Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.	0
People are more likely to donate when they are comfortable and feel like it is good organization.	0
ok that sounds great	0
I reviewed the site quickly.	0
HI there!	0
yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	3
anything else?	0
I am trying to understand how it is decided what child in need gets the help.	6
30 dollars a month can change a child's life	0
Absolutely, they are the future generation and it's imperative that they are nurtured and looked after.	0
In the past few years I rarely have.	0
McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay.	0
I like the sound of their work, but I'm always suspicious about how much of a donation reaches the people in need.	0
Are the children in need all across the world?	6
yes, sure sir	0
You shouldtype the samething and if perhaps if you know anything about the charity, share it?	0
I have donated to them in the past.	0
And you too.	0
I see, you misspelled the charity at the beginning.	5
Great! Thanks so much and I'm just so happy to be able to donate	0
Before I commit to a donation, can you tell me how much actually goes to the children and how much goes to the organization itself?	6
I would be	0
is 20 dollars okay?	0
I have not heard of this charity before!	0
I'm good, and you?	0
Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	3
What do you do in the organization?	0
Thanks I would appreciate your help.	0
They could use some of that money for school supplies.	0
Congratulations to them.	0
Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	3
Great what time is it on?	0
It's a good charity.	0
do they help children in africa	6
I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	0
great and you are you going to donate	0
You never know though.	9
I want to help the children irrespective of their color and creed.	0
That is awesome	0
I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	2
oh at least a thousand	5
hi i am fine..	0
It is nice to know that!	0
When iIsaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iIshould not have ised that term, nor did I mean it lightly, I meant physically donating time and skills.	0
I would love to help.	0
sometimes , it depends on what types	0
pretty good, you?	0
what exactly does the charity do for children?	6
I've been approached by people on the street.	0
I focus on kids and animals.	0
thank you,I just want to help this world and especially the children within it and save the children is doing that job	0
However, I think I'll opt for a one time 0.05 donation instead.	0
I'm not sure how much I would be getting from the task, but I will say $1!	0
But do not fully know.	6
I might.	8
Is it reputable?	9
Hi!	0
That is awesome.	0
Good morning, how are you doing?	0
maybe	0
I am already making a difference in many children lives.	3
hmmm, let me think about it	8
The exchange rate must be pretty good.	5
I want to donate at least 50 dollar maximum would be 200 dollar.	0
Amazing!	0
I just can't see any good being done.	9
I wasn't aware that they did all of that.	0
If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.	4
I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.	8
Wow, that is extremely sad.	0
I'm fine with staying at $0.50 as long as you are	0
hello	0
I would need to know more about the charity first.	8
I think it has to do with helping sick children.	0
I see, can you go into a little bit more details about some of the childhood related causes ?	6
Do you usually donate?	0
That would be real low on my list of priorities.	4
Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world.	0
A couple of organizations claim to do that.	0
I've been thinking of donating to charity, but I could never find the right one.	3
How much of donations go to the kids?	6
Yes, I have.	0
Hot, and well, I think the sun is coming around	0
I'm doing well thank you	0
What was life like for you growing up?	0
That's very helpful.	0
That sounds interesting.	0
you too.	0
Yeah stories like that are very heart breaking.	0
It is a wonderful charity.	0
Im pretty sure that if you want someone to donate to a cause you treat them nicely	0
How are you?	0
Go right ahead.	0
okey.	0
I think so.	0
Maybe.	8
hello how are oyu	0
I think they are a trustworthy organization.	0
i would like to donate but i dont have a lot of money myself.	4
i usually do donate to charities	3
Yeah, I think mostly everyone has, I think charities are mostly good but I don't know that they always accomplis all they could well, with expenses and all	9
So, do we need to chat back and forth a few for times for this to be over?	0
why is that?	2
I'd love to hear more.	0
That sounds perfect	0
How would I go about this?	0
It is very scary to think about.	0
I've heard of it.	0
What does Save the Children do?	6
That's funny that you mention that.	0
It makes me feel like life is so unfair, and those of us who can help, should.	0
but this group sounds great!	0
Imagine not have clean water to drink.	0
Great.	0
If I did have extra money, I would probably donate to St Jude's.	3
Is there a specific age or race of children that Save the Children are looking to benefit?	6
I think so.	0
How does that work?	0
I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	1
Can you tell me more about it?	6
Yes, I am okay with that.	0
I should do more to help.	0
I'll still do $20 and go through the site.	7
It was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.	9
What is in it for you if I donate?	0
How can someone help?	0
So what exactly do they do to help these kids to reunite with their parents?	6
Well, most people suck.	2
I do the same for World Vision.	0
I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	3
I would be willing to at least donate a portion of my earnings to help this charity.	0
They look really good.	0
I do have a few questions first.	0
that's great maybe we could both donate to them	0
Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.	0
What do you think?	0
I can spare a quarter if it helps.	0
At least you're doing some good, though.	0
is $20 okay?	0
I will be honest, what I had heard though wasnt positive.	9
That's really awesome, are they more in need of supplies or monetary donations?	6
What type of help do you provide to those poor families?	6
It's really nice outside where I am so I am sitting outdoors.	0
It would feed a child for almost 3 days.	0
how does the operation afford staff?	6
What else can you tell me about the charity?	6
Have you ever donated to this organization and if so, how much?	2
I mean, a penny is nothing in the grand scheme of things.	0
i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?	2
I think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	0
I will donate I'm just not sure how much.	7
I used to tutor kids in my spare time in college.	0
it is sad, i agree with you	0
do you donate to them?	2
I will donate all of $2 then :)	0
I do	0
Make a wish is really cool.	0
A dollar?	0
What childrens charity is this?	0
Maybe you could tell me more about this charity	0
That seems worthwhile.	0
What type of people or who manages this fund?	6
What kind of children does it help?	6
I don't know which one and presumably talk about a donation to said charity.	0
Do you know if this is tax deductible?	0
show a pic of a kid etc.	6
Do you already donate to them?	0
When it isn't available, I think it's important to provide for them if we can.	0
Yes.	0
Sure, as long as you can help me out as well... you see, I have a child that is overseas, in a warzone.	4
I will not donate anything $0.	1
No, not currently.	0
I think this is the last chat exchange.	0
How am I charged for donations?	6
Ok, I will do 5 cents of my task money.	0
that's really good to hear!	0
mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.	0
I think I would rather donate to a childrens charity that takes care of American children.	0
Really sad situation.	0
I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	8
It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.	1
I don't know yet.	0
And why do so many of these countries continually need help?	2
Children hold the future of the world.	0
Yes I don't mind if there is a feature I can turn on where every hit I do, a few cents go to the charity of my choice.	0
Yes I know I will donate 5 dollars	0
I do not feel guilty, did you donate?	2
God bless and good morning.	0
yes of course	0
Thank you, I will do it for sure, have a nice day	0
Do you participate in any local children's charities?	0
yes, i guess i can.	0
That's an honorable reason. :)	0
Especially for third world country that have limited resources	0
Yes I would.	0
I feel good about this.	0
Why are you passionate about this particular one?	0
hi!	0
Thats good, I see they are ready to help out with the hurricane in Hawaii for the kids.	0
Have you ever donated to them?	2
That way i know where my money is going.	0
It makes me scared for her and my nephews as well.	0
You also have a good day	0
Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?	0
I'm not sure that I have.	0
It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.	0
On my side I don't have information about the task, only that we are trying to come up with a donation agreement.	0
What sort of assistance do they offer specifically?	6
That is nice.	0
OK no problem I will find out.	0
Children are the futere	0
Hello!	0
I want to give a donation to help them.	0
That sounds important.	0
How does it help children?	6
Maybe I'll consider donating to them	8
Wow!That's really great!	0
Thank you very much.	0
That sounds like a decent organization.	0
Go on...	0
So do I.	0
Thats very sweet of you.	0
Thanks, warmest regards from Alabama	0
hi how are you	0
Yeah?	0
Let me ask, are you also able to donate, and if so how much are you able to spare?	2
Even they are not able to get good meal and got suffered from many malnutrition diseases.	0
I will agree to donate $0.15 then.	0
Or just the United States?	6
Maybe we will get a dollar.	0
This is true but alot of charities don't represent the individuals they portray to help.	9
In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	0
How did you come to find out about this charity?	6
where was it locate	6
What kind of things do they help with?	6
Sounds like they do a lot of good for a lot of people around the world.	0
I feel bad about only giving $5, do you think we should give more?	6
Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	6
Is this an American charity?	6
If a child would like to send me a letter and picture of theirselves, I would be delighted.	5
I know Syria is a mess recently	5
Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	0
What about you?	0
I am more interested in this.	0
Yes that is true.	0
So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!	6
how much are you thinking of donating	2
Well that is great!	0
yes i have heard of it, it is very good what they are doing.	0
hopefully many more people help out so that they can get food and medicine	0
I am all for helping children in any way possible.	0
Sure I will donate 20 cents.	0
Yes, i agree	0
But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most	0
Okay that sounds good but how much would a donation of that size be?	0
what are your children's age ?	0
I am fine.	0
I hope you enjoy!	0
I would like to, but I really can afford to donate anything right now.	4
I'm sorry I meant $20	0
that is not bad	0
I would be happy to listen.	0
I've seen a lot of commercials about them, but never did a lot of research about them.	0
I am I am thinking of people here I dont care about the rest	3
I'm thinking about whether this is better than other charities I give to	8
Okay that sounds nice and an important service	0
I'll donate $0.05	0
I believe it!	0
Who runs the organization now?	6
Things like that?	6
Id like to make a donation, how do I do that	0
It's only fair.	0
no, I need to though!	0
Thank you so much.	0
I took a look at the website.	0
i also usually focus that	0
I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	0
Children are one of the worlds most important assets.	0
And its awesome that you help out those kids in need	0
They save miniture IG dogs.	0
I still do not want to make a donation from this money.	1
I could do that.	0
Yes I have.	0
How many children do they serve each year and how much of a donation are you talking about?	6
I used to volunteer often, but I have so little time it feels like now!	0
5$ sounds good ok	0
I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward.	0
That is appealing.	0
Sounds amazing.	0
Yes, As soon as i get enough money	7
Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	0
I have a dachsund/pit mix named Tuttle.	0
How would this donation be made?	0
I have heard of that organization.	0
I'd love to help 1000 children.	0
Yes they will	0
Thank you so much for telling me about this.	0
In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	0
I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	3
yes, I believe i have , is it for kids with Cancer?	6
That's great!	0
They do a lot for kids	0
this is nice.	0
That is such a great cause	0
It's important to give every child an opportunity to succeed.	0
doing fine, what about you	0
At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	3
Yes, because it is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	0
Kuddos to them!	0
I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	0
we have to walk early and late.	0
That's impressive.	0
I hope you are well.	0
I am not sure about where all the donation money ends up.	6
You have no facts to back that up.	5
Alright I will donate.	0
absolutely i will support them.	0
I can $1 today	0
Well theres a charity called Skateistan that is championed by the famous skater Tony Hawk And the majority of their donations go to direct service and help children out all of the world whom live in the most vulnerable situations.	0
Hello	0
.60 still sounds good to me.	0
ok how ill give that much	0
hello i am fine thank you	0
What Dollar you need to give For children charity?	0
We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	0
I agree all the way that they are the best creations of all.	0
I wish I could do more.	0
I am interested to help.	0
It makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would I cope?	0
What's your feelings about giving to children's charities?	0
yes, sometimes with non profits	0
I'm always so skeptical of charities to be honest.	3
Established 1919	0
That is good.	0
I'd rather contribute my donation locally.	3
I'll start with $1 and maybe give more later :)	0
Sure!	0
its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	0
I think this is a fair percentage to have.	0
ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	0
You are really helping our country's children.	0
What is your families business and what do you enjoy most of the Save the Children charity?	0
I'm doing very well.	0
i do not	0
i am donating .30 cents for your organization.	0
In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	0
Maybe 0.50?	0
Are we attempting to agree on a donation amount?	0
I'm sorry that it seems so little, but as I already donate to an organization and I use the payments here to save for a vacation coming up...	4
Why are you talking about this charity instead of the others?	2
Yea what do you got?	0
I think it is very important to help children that are less fortunate.	0
I don't purchase coffee	5
Especially now with so many children separated from their families because of the immigration disputes, I hope they can help children here even in America as well!	0
I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	0
I think it would be roughly $1.20.	0
I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.	0
I agree with that.	0
Are you going to donate?	0
Wow that sounds like a really robust program.	0
That's good.	0
Oh I see so they have a website that I could learn more about them.	0
Also, I have another question for you if you have a minute.	0
Sure.	0
The money would at least go to a good cause.	0
i will donate now 5 dl	0
Okay.	0
That's pretty impressive!	0
Sure, I will match your $0.50.	0
money?	0
How many years has Save The Children been doing charity work?	6
Thats not my problem they have people in that country	2
hi there!	0
do they help lots of kids	6
I hope you're able to raise a lot of donations.	0
global?	6
I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.	0
Do you know anyone personally who has benefited from charities ?	0
That's a really good number considering the overhead that must be required for international relief.	0
Really?	0
You too!	0
Sure, I will donate 10 cents	0
Doing MTurk to get my student loans paid off so that I can be more generous as a whole.	4
Probably more.	0
are they legit?	9
I'm not a nurse though, and couldn't possibly travel to Africa or anywhere else.	0
YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	0
I have made donations in the past, but our money is bit tight since I'm a stay-at-home mom right now.	4
I think it's the astronomical costs of healthcare.	0
I still know nothing about the charity and I\'m already a half hour into a 2 dollar HIT.	0
i know it's not much, but wanted to do something.	0
Ok, well thank you for your time and telling me about this wonderful organization.	0
do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?	0
I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	9
why do you don't want to donate?	2
We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.	0
Do they help children from a particular country or is it all around the world?	6
I am considering a donation.	8
I chose to donate $0.	1
I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.	3
Well tell me a little bit more about the charity.	6
From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.	0
I wish there was a long-term solution to these problems.	2
What does the organization provide?	6
Yes, I think I would be will to donate to the cause.	0
I'm going to donate half .10 - So i Can feed a child for a day	0
I would do the same	0
I think this charity also helps with kids over seas in haiti too.	0
Really?	0
i use to	3
I'm doing very well thank you!	0
OK - what specifically were you thinking about?	0
how are you?	0
How does a person go about making a donation?	0
Thanks for the info, guess I am skeptical.	0
Ok how much do you need?	0
Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.	0
I'd be fine with donating $1.00 though and i'd keep the other.	0
thanks	0
In America food is plentiful and we sometimes have to stop and reflect, that other countries aren't as fortunate as we are!	0
With e environment and food system.	5
God bless!	0
I'm glad and happy to help!	0
Do you know how much of the donations actually make it to children and how much is used for administrative costs?	6
I have to go to work at 11:30-6.	0
i'll donate 20 cents	0
I have heard about them.	0
I am curious why you chose the words "rural America"?	0
with the hurricane coming soon.	0
I also ive to bakc to school drives and food pantries	3
I will donate 10 cents	0
But it's been mostly local church related activities.	0
I'm sorry to hear about your nephew?	0
I work with children more in an "urban" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.	3
Yes.	0
30 or more	0
Please explain to me in detail	0
I'll definitely go and make a donation today.	0
Thank you for your kind words.	0
Should this HIT not be ending, I think it has had more than 10 rounds?	0
I agree.	0
I'm sorry.	0
I see, and do they provide medical help as well?	6
All the way in Africa.	0
Ok, sounds good.	0
I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though.	0
its my pleasure	0
I totally agree, I think if you can, you should help others in need	0
Okay, if you don	0
Yes, For child care.	0
no, can you tell me more about it?	6
Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	0
there are so many starving and abused kids here in the US that I'd feel more comfortable helping them first.	3
I choose 0.30 dollar for donation	0
I wonder what the member recommendation is for St Jude	0
I am so grateful there is a way for me to help financially!!!	0
Not exactly, but I'm sure it's thousands	0
Because I like children	0
yes i am	0
There are so many worthy causes that I try hard to make sure my meeker amounts go to benefit the most.	0
No I am not, but like I said.	0
I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	0
where are you from?	0
ok will check it out	7
Yes, I would :)	0
How much should we donate?	0
Oh!	0
And you?	0
If we can get a group of Investors this organization can reach a larger spectrum	0
I'm glad they do that but there are many charities that claim to do the same thing.	2
Those children need your help.	0
How much are you looking for?	0
i wonder what a reasonable donation amount would be.	0
Are you familiar with it?	6
Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	0
Are you willing to match my 10 cent donation to Save the Children	0
Education?	6
I do enjoy donating to charities.	0
Thanks.	0
But do you really trust the charities that you give to?	9
That;s great!	0
Do you have any kids?	0
Yes, It's an is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	0
definitely, have you donated to them?	0
How much is the typical donation amount usually?	0
i would be willing to donate 0.2 $ , i know it is not what others aspect me to give.	0
Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	0
Certainly as long as I know the donation will help the children	0
I don't eat candy.	5
I'm good, how are you?	0
$5.00 i would donate	0
How much would you donate if given the chance to help a childrens charity?	2
I have never seen this organization help them.	3
Sure i would love to	0
Ok if that were true what is their succession rate of getting through to the children or progression rate.	6
Well that sounds just great to me!	0
Very welcome.	0
I think we should donate at least 17 dollars but less than 19 dollars	0
children must be educated i didn\'t heard about"save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	0
I'm really glad to hear that.	0
Good morning, I think children are so important and charities that involve them are needed and we should participate our money or our time.	0
What can I do to help?	0
i'm sure you love children, right?	0
Do you take credit cards?	0
I think I'm ok.	1
Sure, I'm happy to donate half the payment for the HIT	0
I could maybe do less as well?	0
Are there different tiers for donations available?	6
This should be the tenth response, I suspect we will be able to submit	0
if I define what makes me happy in life is to look and my beloved happy man	0
You're right, it is very important.	0
ok cool, weve got a few more, any other charities	3
That's wonderful!	0
Ok sounds cool	0
Especially if they are children.	0
how much of the money is put to work?	6
I wish you well.	0
Hi, it all depends on who you really are, if it's for a person very close to me if I'm willing	7
It hurts my heart.	0
Hi, i'm doing great! how are you?	0
o.k. 20 cents for now agreed and regular for 6 months, o.k.?	0
I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	0
I am very curious to how the decision is made and what type of medical care they plan to deliver.	6
Are you aware of any childrens charities?	0
I have not!	0
I'm aware of how to donate and how easy it is.	0
Not without knowing the exact organization	3
I agree, this is a good cause.	0
I am more willing to help a charity that will help right here in America	3
Yes, and then most are willing to provide proof that they actually donated money, so that is good.	0
That is wonderful, whenever there are charity events or donations being taken.	0
No i am not can you explain?	6
thanks so much!	0
Have a great day	0
I do not purchase candy too often; however, I could definitely sacrifice a Starbucks Coffee to help children in need.	5
That sounds fantastic!	0
I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	0
I'm good!	0
and what country or countries are these children located in	6
I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.	0
I definitely.	0
same here!	0
I don't believe I have.	0
If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	0
no i havent	0
Thinking about starving children makes me so sad.	0
How long have you been involved?	6
I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	0
are you based in America? are you an American?	0
You sure?	0
right, well i feel horrible only saying $0 but i will say $0.00 because i want to go the website with my daughter and look it over and then donate there so she can be part of it	1
I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.	0
oh i would donate money too even it 5 dollars	0
On what foundation can I sponsor?	6
I'm doing well.	0
Therefore, we could help the children for their livelihood as well as for their education.	0
That would defintely interest me.	0
I just feel that if they help a few children get a better childhood then it is worth it.	0
Gotcha!	0
sure, but first i need to know for what need will i donate and what organization	0
Mostly into hiking these days - how about you?	0
Yes, But I remember what it gave me.	3
seeking job	0
Okay, please tell me about the charity.	6
where are the children from?	6
As far as donating I have no problem donating to a greater cause as long as it benefits others short term and long term.	9
hello.	0
As you can tell, it's something I'm very concerned about!	0
I am glad you were there to help him.	0
I understand that, and you guys raise money here on this site?	0
I couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids.	0
ok thank you sounds good,	0
I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	0
It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.	0
Its paying me .30	0
I may consider a donation.	0
well, I'm glad to hear such a good news from this organisation.	0
You can send me the information with the email you have on file for me. :)	0
They didn't choose that life.	0
How much do you usually donate every year>	6
Oh wow, I would also be interested in donating to that.	0
That is a solid informational link, including a full board of trustees to look into.	0
It was a pleasure talking to you as well!	0
you also done a great job	0
How do you receive payments?	0
You're welcome!	0
Oh wow!	0
How would I donate directly from this task?	0
That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	4
Where do I sign up?	0
And share on social media could be the next step?	0
Yeah - I try to donate once a month or so	3
Where did you get that information and who specifically is the money going to?	6
I will happily donate my whole payment for this task. :)	0
Are you involved with them at all?	0
no can you tell me a little about it	6
What is the money used for mostly?Food?Toys?Clothes?	6
Sure.I would be glad to. How much money do you think I should give?	6
There are many homeless adults and adolescents that do not know where their next meal is coming from, or if it will ever arrive.	5
Yes, few dollars can save a child or can help a family to survive for a month.	0
Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children.	0
Yes I do.	0
How long have you been supporting this charity?	0
Would 60% of the task payment be enough?	0
I don't have much money for myself either which is why I consider this to be my part time job.	4
What charity are you involved in?	0
Glad to help.	0
No problem have a good night	0
It sucks that not all people and children have the comfort of having a stable place to stay or the comfort of knowing they are able to eat.	0
I like the sound of that!	0
is there an upper limit?	0
Yes I am, thank you for asking.	0
maybe i will do	8
oh ok, who is they?	6
Okay, I would definitely donate to them!	0
Nice!!!	0
Do how much are you donating	2
What is Save the Children about?	6
Yes I have but don't know a whole lot about them since there are so many children related charities.	0
how are you?	0
What country is in the most need right now?	6
i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	0
I've heard of them.	0
I am willing to donate $ 10	0
No, not really.	0
Could you please tell me more about this charity?	6
I suppose not.	0
More as where are the majority of the fund headed towards right now/	6
I will definitely be making the donation.	0
yes thats ok	0
Of course I'll donate something	0
What do you think?	2
That's always good, it's not good to donate somewhere that they don't give to what they're supposed to be donating to	9
How is your day going so far?	0
Do you have personal experience?	0
Is that something that you personally do?	0
I have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.	0
I would think it is very valuable	0
I would be willing to donate the money from this task for sure.	0
A request by a children's charity for a donation.	0
no I have not...what is it about?	0
I am mostly aware yes.	0
I don't usually donate to charities.	0
Point taken.	0
I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids.	0
No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	0
yes I have.	0
I am good with donating $10 right now.	0
it does.	0
Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	0
THis has been a great hit.	0
My husband and I have a small NGO in Mindanao, Philippines, and it is amazing what a little bit of money can do to make things better.	0
No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	0
Or is it just save the children?	0
I see - how many years have you been with them	0
That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	0
It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	0
You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.	9
I'll donate $10	0
I give Â£3 a week so around Â£36 a year.	0
Is there anything else you can think of that we could do?	0
How about yourself?	0
But we can't help them directly.	0
that is true.	0
Okay, so we are in agreement on the amount and donating, what else do we need to discuss?	0
Good luck to you!	0
You do make a point.	0
Yes I will give my earnings to the Save the Children charity.	0
Hopefully, more the people born more lucky can lend a hand.	0
It makes me very sad!	0
We must help the children to give education.	0
Actually, their own website may be a biased barometer of their giving.	9
well that would be a good but I would want to research them first to make sure they are good but maybe you have already done that	3
If it makes you happy, go ahead and take .50	0
Yes, I know about Syria.	0
No, I can do it.	0
I was wondering that.	0
actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly	1
hai whats up	0
I have seen a lot of commercials on TV for it.	0
I'm proud too.nice working with you.	0
well maybe you could donate to my child.	2
Hey there how's it going?	0
It looks like they do great work.	0
Hello, I'm alright.	0
of course i would, its the least i could do to help the children in the world.	0
I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	1
Very true. $5 it is. At least we are giving something. Most people wouldn't.	2
I think 0.50 cents is a perfect amount to donate.	0
Yes, I'm not sure either, but it just kills me to know there are ids suffering.	0
Yes, I have two.	0
I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	0
I will defiantly be donating at the first of September though.	7
I donate sometimes well, to other charities	3
Possibly, do they have a website?	3
such an important job!	0
Did they provide housing for kids that went against their culture beliefs?	6
IT looks really good and professional.	0
Charities need regular support.	0
They are the weak ones in my eyes.	0
Do you have information about their charity rating?	6
Not interested right now to do so.	1
I can afford $5.00	0
Most definitely doesand hope it will make someone else feel 10 times just as great	0
Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity?	0
Have you?	0
That is a great way to think about it.	0
I see, well, I'd love to do that then	0
It sounds like fun.	0
Oh, from my personal account?	6
What do you think is the best solution or way to help for the average person like you or Me to render aid?	0
Do you have the link to the site	6
I make money as a musician so basically I don't make money.	4
Thank you for your time.	0
How do I know it is a legitimate charity?	9
i would love to donate .30 for sure	0
Yes, that was going to be my next question.	0
That's interesting and sounds good, right?	0
That is a huge impact.	0
I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	0
Sure, please tell me about the organization	0
Sure, let's do it.	0
Thank you!	0
I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.	0
I also send him little care packages every so often.	0
No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me!	0
Both of my parents were employed and were able to provide for me and my siblings.	0
Always.	0
ugh yeah, i've seen that, you sit there waiting forever for someone to type two words haha	0
i'd donate more but i don't have much myself	4
Every now and then I volunteer within my community.	0
ok so wht do you suggest?	0
I have thought about it before.	0
I spend more than that on coffee every week!	0
What forms of payments are accepted?/	6
definitely I like to help in anyway that I can to help children and animals.	0
I am very happy to help	0
I hope this kind of environment changes for them.	0
Good point, I think I may consider it	8
What makes them untrustworthy?	0
How are you?	0
You?	0
I'm glad to hear that.	0
That seems reasonable.	0
Thank you too.	0
Any child that needs help deserves it.	0
i just don't know why i've never heard about it	9
well, it is a charity work / organisation where they save many children	0
that's a fair point	0
Wow thats great.	0
If I have two very beautiful children that are my life, maybe that's why I'm very attentive to things like this of this magnitude	0
Is there a monetary goal set for the year?	6
I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.	3
Glad you took your time.	0
Good morning!	0
thats true to help them	0
I made $100+ everyday last week on Mturk and now all I have left is these low paying surveys	0
sure would love to	0
Tha k you for my awareness	0
Where, on their website?	0
I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.	4
I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.	0
I want the money to do with as I choose.	3
do i close this window now	0
I guess so	0
I would like to start making a difference today.	0
It sounds familiar.	0
I was donate the amount of 10 cents......	0
i know it will	0
My kids are 4 and 7.	0
I also agreed to donate but before that I need more information, why do you keep asking me to donate?	0
It may -- but at this point I really still have no idea what Save the Children is and I would want to research it anyway before I would agree to give money to it.	7
how would i do it now	0
Great idea!!	0
Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.	0
save th Children help kids in need around the world	0
of course i would donate, how much are you willing to donate?	0
Ok, I will definitely help out.	0
I am poor and I can relate to the children who are also poor.	4
great you too	0
Yea, ive came across it a few times on different internet ads.	0
education?	0
That sounds like a very worthy cause.	0
Its because I dont trust non profits	9
Oh that's great!	0
What can we do to help?	0
Hmm, I can do maybe 100.	0
However I am not getting a reward from this hit.	0
Sure I would	0
I have not.	0
Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	0
It makes me feel that even though not enough I have done a little something.	0
Ok, well use your passion for the cause to speak nicely to people and educate them on why its important	0
Have you heard any break thought about this charity?	6
Will we also be helping children soliders?	6
I am an informed donor and want to make sure my money is really helping these children	6
that's very sad.	0
It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.	0
Anything that helps children succeed is definitely a great cause	0
I agree, it has been very nice chatting with you and I hope you have a great day.	0
I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	0
let's do 1	0
I have donated a few times to them too.	3

I hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older.	0

I am very interested in the welfare of the children especially in regard to food and education which I consider as very important for children	0

I'm often skeptical of big charities like that.	9
How are you today?	0
I want to help out as much as I can.	0
I do for Boys & Girls Clubs of America	0
Alright.	0
i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	0
I have heard that they work hard to give kids a better life.	0
Those less fortunate deserve better.	0
Then it looks like we can both really help out.	0
Well it is a bit rainy, and it has been cold, but we are going to get a heat wave in the high 80's this week!	0
yes i like to give out things	0
Especially animal organizations.	2
I have to get going.	0
Alright, I will donate 25 cents.	0
Children and Animals are the most precious of God's creations.	0
yeah, that is true.	0
I like to learn as much as I can about an organization before donating.	0
It seems like Syria seems to be a high stakes area.	0
If I donate to this charity your talking about I need to know the name and information to agree to a donation	0
Are there any other charities I can donate to?	0
that sounds great.	0
I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.	0
Thanks very much, nice speaking to you.	0
If they don't, it's completely understandable.	0
Absolutely.	0
in my church we help people no matter their age, but children are special for us	0
Thank you for your recognition.	0
That's good to know that they're reputable.	0
Are there any good charities that are helping on this issue?	6
i do like to donate to charities and this one sounds good because i want to help children but how do i know they are legit?	9
Its extremely sad.	0
There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket.	0
I won't be donating as part of this survey.	1
I also want to make sure my donations are not going into the pockets of money hungry CEO's.	9
What does the charity do/what are my funds going to be used for?	6

That is a great cause.	0
I would like to donate half of my payment.	0

What do they do?	6
Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.	0

These days there are tons of people asking for donations for fake charities, it's sad.	0
And how is the charity promoted?	6
Are we supposed to mutually agree to both give a certain amount?	0
At least a portion of it.	0
I agree it's for a good cause.	0
every other month or so, but not to them	0
Okay, I will make a donation for $10.	0
I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them.	0
I know that it is a charity.	0
I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?	6
But its ok, I work every Sunday.	0
I don't have much money at all.	4
To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	4

I would consider it.	0
