58,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,I was looking for something in the 1500-1600 range,
59,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,"That is really unreasonable considering all the immenities and other going rates, you would need to come up to at least 3000",
60,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,0,"I have seen some 2 bedrooms for that price, which I could split the cost with a roommate, so even with amenities, this may be out of my range",
61,C_4db427e052ea4ae5adc922a65928c578,1,it may be then... the absolute lowest i will go is 2700. that is my final offer.,

143,C_42693ef870d4469083c2efcc5400d34f,0,cool. I see the price is $49 but its too pricey for me.,
144,C_42693ef870d4469083c2efcc5400d34f,1,"For me too, it would cost me $50 to have someone come take it and throw it away",
145,C_42693ef870d4469083c2efcc5400d34f,0,well I can only pay $45 because that's what I can afford honestly.,
146,C_42693ef870d4469083c2efcc5400d34f,1,That's fair,
147,C_42693ef870d4469083c2efcc5400d34f,0,great so we're good with the price?,

2369,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,0,I would like to make an offer.  The color isn't what I was interested and I really would prefer a foot versus hand brake for safety.  Do you have any flexiblility on your price?,
2370,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,"Please do make an offer. I have some flexibility, but not much.",

2408,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well, when you consider the fine crafstmanship, and the fact that it will universally fit in some vehicles, I think $50 is a steal.",
2409,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,That's definitely a good price. My problem is I have only $30 bucks and don't get paid until friday and my friend's birthday is tomorrow.,
2410,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well, that's okay, I can take credit cards through my online store ;)",
2411,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,I can do you one better. I have 5 lbs of gummy bears that have been sealed since I bought them. How about I literally sweeten the deal by giving you all 5 lbs of gummy bears and 30 bucks?,
2412,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,1,"Well I'm sure that would appeal to some sellers, but unfortunately I'm an end stage diabetic, which is why I have to sell my sub box, so I couldn't eat any sugar :(",
2413,C_8c342b65e72e4956afe3b89b5d17eb22,0,"Oh no worries, I have 3 lbs of sugar free gummy bears! Great for diabetics and being constipated! How about I pick that sub box up and drop off the 30 bucks with your sugar free colon cleansers...er...gummy bears?",

2446,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,"Ok, great.  I think I could work with you on waiving the pet deposit, as long as I could check your current or past landlords references pertaining to the pets, that no damage was caused by them.",
2447,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,Thank you. That sounds fine to me. If I were to go ahead and sign a 2 year lease instead of just 1 would you be able to drop the price down to $3000?,
2448,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,Would you be able to pay the deposit in full ?,
2449,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,I would indeed!,
2450,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,"Ok, Great!  So, just to reiterate, you would sign a 2 year lease agreement at $3,000 per month and pay a $3,000 security deposit.  The pet deposit will be waived upon satisfactory reference check with current and previous landlords.",
2451,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,Sounds perfect!,

2678,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Great, how about yourself?",
2679,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,Doing well. You're interested in my ad for the BMW X5? It's a great looking vehicle with only 117k miles on it.,
2680,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Yeah, I was looking around and it caught my eye. I would be willing to pay $5400 for it right now. I have the cash and could make the payment today. Of course, I would like to take a look at it first and possible take it for a test spin.",
2681,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"Understood. I'm asking $9,000 for it at the moment. We could definitely arrange for a test drive, but I don't think I can be that flexible on the price.",
2682,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Hmm, well I think the asking price is too steep considering the year and the car having 117k miles on it. I just bought a 2011 VW GTI with 56k on it for 9,000. I think I can go up to around $6,500 for this BWM. Anything more is too much in my opinion.",
2683,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"So while it's a 2006 model, it is a rather large BMW sports utility vehicle.  Luxury SUVs hold their value well and BMW doesn't change their styling much from year to year. I could go $8,000.",
2684,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"I don't think I can do $8,000.",
2685,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"Well, this is a great looking vehicle, it was just cleaned and detailed and is really ready to go.",
2686,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"How about $7,000?",
2687,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"I could split the difference and do $7,500.",

2698,C_8f54debd567e409fa84bd21e5c928a30,1,"that will all change when you get this dresser and night stand, it will literally change your socioeconomic status, I'd really like to get a little more for it, would you be able to $180?",
2699,C_8f54debd567e409fa84bd21e5c928a30,0,Well if it's for self improvement... I can go $170 then,
2700,C_8f54debd567e409fa84bd21e5c928a30,1,"That seems fair if you can come get it, it's a pain strapping this thing on my moped",

3387,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Well I love the bike but I had been riding cross country on an endurance bike. So this has been fairly unused. No malfunctions I had made sure to periodically spray it with anti rust and anti seeze. Also it was left in a dry and secure environment.,
3388,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,"Okay that's good ti know. However, the price is very high for me. Is there anyway that we can work on that?",
3389,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Yes but Id prefer to not go too low as I said before I love the bike and I am reluctuant to sell. Mainly selling due to me down sizing and lack of use.,
3390,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,I can offer $390 as its old and has been sitting. Would appreciate it if you consider it,
3391,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,390 is a bit harsh on me. Tell you what I can add a free delivery and a standard set of maintenace equipment specific to this type of bike,
3392,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,What's the last price you can give me?,
3393,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,lets start at 550 and negotiate in increments of 10 from there?,
3394,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,"I can give you $500 honestly, I can't go beyond that because It doesn't fit my budget after that. ]",
3395,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,1,Ok 500 I can do and Ill also add a 1 year waranty on the chain to prove how sure I am of this bike.,
3396,C_2ccbbc45e78847cd81f8b3cc75005600,0,That's absolutely great! Thanks then we got a deal!,
3412,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,0,"Hi, how many cabinets come with it?",
3413,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,1,There are two cabinets and they are still brand new in the packaging.,
3414,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,0,Does the price include putting them up?,
3415,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,1,"No, sorry the price doesn't include installation.",
3416,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,0,"Well, I would want to do around $60 then, how does that sound?",
3417,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,1,$60 is a little low since they are brand new. How about come up a little to $70?,
3418,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,0,"Would you be willing to deliver them, I am in the area?",
3419,C_4abc0907f13a4a5b83cf831b8c35574b,1,"If you live around the Oakland area, I can deliver them.",

3444,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,"Sounds good! I'm aware that the listing says $95, but I'm willing to negotiate.",
3445,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,0,"That's good to know. Before that, the listing mentions its from IKEA. Does it have any scratches or marks? since its black in color and I am buying it for my new house. So, I would like it to look like new and not used.",
3446,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,"It does have some minor scratches. Not too noticeable unless you look really, really closely. For that, I'm willing to bring the price down a bit.",
3447,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,0,"I see. Okay, I am willing to pay $87 for it. Does it sound good to you?",
3448,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,"I was hoping not to go too low. For right now, the lowest I will go is $90.",
3449,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,0,"I would appreciate it if you consider going down a bit more, because I also need to come pick it up so its also commute in here. Please consider going down a bit.",
3450,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,I am more than willing to drop this off with you. That's absolutely not a problem.,
3451,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,0,Okay then sounds good to me!,
3452,C_c43f2b16c2dc4bd683dba92412a93b5d,1,So we have a deal on $90?,

3496,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,1,I see you are interested in my sofa.  Any questions?,
3497,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,0,Is it clean?,
3498,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,1,Yes it is!  I have been the only owner and it has been in my den for several years so it did not get as much use as my main couch.,
3499,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,0,Any pet hairs on it or smoker smells?,
3500,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,1,"I am a non smoker, so there are no smoker smells.  It is a bit faded and there are some small scratches from my cat but no pet hairs on it.  I've also recently used a good leather cleaner on it so it is quite shiny.",
3501,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,0,Would it fit in my Toyota backseat or should I bring my SUV?,
3502,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,1,It's pretty wide so I would suggest utilizing the SUV.,
3503,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,0,"ok, I will offfer you $38 since you don;t deliver and I would have to drive to go get it. Does $38 sound good?",
3504,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,1,It's in pretty good condition.  I'd be willing to take 40.,
3505,C_53bb184f15494f41bb1940f3c5f22bdd,0,"OK, sounds fair. $40 it is than. I will pick it up in 20 minutes.",

3520,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,Great!,
3521,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,It looks like a great couch but the price is rather high for me.,
3522,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"Well,it is unbelievably comfortable.It just clashed with my other furniture.I can maybe go down a little?",
3523,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"I was hoping to pay maybe half if possible, ideally. That seems like a good price for a used couch.",
3524,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,I wouldn't call it used.I think it was sat on twice so the price listed is practically a steal!How about $950?,
3525,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Hmm. I could go $600, how about that? By the way is the couch easy to disassemble, or does it have to be moved intact? I'm thinking about how easily it could be transported.",
3526,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"Hello, Do you have any interest in my couch for sale?",
3527,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Yes, I think it is a quite attractive couch, although that is a lot of money for me right now. I was hoping to pay maybe half of what you're asking--what do you think?",
3528,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,You are right about it being attractive! Give me a price and I will see what I can do.,
3529,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Well, how about $500? I know it's much less than you are asking for, but I'd be giving it a great home!",
3530,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"I'd love for it to have a great home, but I need to have a home too! LoL! How about $850?",
3531,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Oh, we're definitely moving in the right direction! That's still a bit steep for me but...well...I really like that it is made from largely recycled materials. How about $600? By the way can this couch be easily dissasembled for transport? If not I'm probably going to have to rent a small moving truck.",
3532,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"Tell you what. I will deliver it to you assembled at no extra charge.Plus, I'll even throw in two free throw pillows all for $825.Oh yes, it is made from recycled materials.That is a wonderful thing!",
3533,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,Thanks for offering to deliver it assembled if we can come to an agreement--that will make it much easier on my end. It's still a bit pricey for me. How about $725?,
3534,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"If you factor in the price of a moving truck with my offer it is a steal!You'd be paying less with my deal,but since I feel you truly love this couch I will drop it down to $800 and still provide my additional services!",
3535,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Well...that is more than I can comfortably pay but it is a very attractive couch and since you're offering to set it up, I will accept your offer of $800.",
3536,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,Great! You won't be sorry. Let's get this transaction started! Thank you!,

3706,C_f6be264c6aa34b3e93d9ebcaa8676666,1,"i would consider $750 if you came and pick it up, can't let it go any cheaper sorry.",

3851,C_c8b72e036d1147ca9f2b61f39c7d96dc,1,"It's a very rare, classic bike is why the price is $175.",

4011,C_f2834cdded0b46ef8e99f2dcdfe7e849,1,"That's a fair point, but $40 is too low for me. I'll go up to $65 for it, and won't charge extra for the delivery.",

4847,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,0,I could do $3300,
4848,C_ec2b2a0521fe40e7b6429fcab80bb88d,1,That's a bit low for me. I need a little more to put towards the ring I'm buying my fiance. I could part with it for $3900,

4860,C_d127e4b2cabd4c3e84c2bbc6d90137e0,1,I can't do that. Sorry. 600 really is the lowest. Maybe this drone isn't for you,

5232,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,Okay. That's good to hear. What do you think about $5000 even for it. Of course you know that you priced it a bit high.,
5233,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,1,I researched and that is more than fair market value. I am willing to lower it but feel 5000 is too low.,
5234,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,"Well, it's a used car without a warranty. I can go a little bit higher than 5k, but I need a warranty.",

5238,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,"Okay, well in that case, I feel quite a bit better about the fact that there aren't any pictures. How about an even 6000? I am going up a whole thousand more than I want to pay here, please budge for me!!!",

5512,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,1,"automatic , it's really great",
5513,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,0,"perfect. I am very interested in purchasing this vehicle, since this is a car you no longer need and since it is such high mileage are you willing to negotiate on the price. The listed price is just a little above my budget.",
5514,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,1,"ok we can work something out, what can you do",
5515,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,0,I'm concerned about any repairs and maintenance that I may have to do. I'm looking closer to the 2100.00 price range,
5516,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,1,"yeah it went for a full check up and it runs great, o you ok on that, but 2100 is way out of my range",
5517,C_d40d1c392c1249e8a07e6f90b8e4193a,0,"I'm not sure If I can do much more, while it looks great I would need to be able to take the car to a mechanic that I trust in order to go much higher than this. Without the most I could go is 2500",

5635,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,"Sure. Shame to let it go because of how much I love it, but it's great if you wanna go downhill. It has a raceface handlebars and stem evolve, WTB seat, moto and cranks and Maxxis high roller tires.",
5636,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,0,How long have you owned it for?   Are you the original owner?,
5637,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,"That's right. It's mine only, and I've owned for about a few months give or take, so it's not in the worst condition at all. How much are we willing to negotiate?",
5638,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,0,"Well, $800 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $650 if I were to come and pick it up?  Might save you a little bit of hassle....",
5639,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,That s a lot lower than I hoped it would be. I want to sell it for $775 because of how close it is to that of a brand new bike in terms of quality.,
5640,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,0,Hmmm....How about $725?,
5641,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?",

5684,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Hi, the cabinets are brand new and unopened - they're great, but just don't fit in my kitchen.",
5685,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,How long have you had them?,
5686,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"I bought them about 3 months ago, and still have the receipts.",
5687,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,0,Okay. Do you know if Home Depot can still special order these cabinets?,
5688,C_01ac7239fef54abeb05a1e23c26b93e5,1,"Yes, they still carry the line so you should still be able to order them.",

5703,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"I am the original owner, bought it new in 2006.  Great vehicle - has never left me stranded.  The interior is nearly pristine and the exterior looks very good (some dings like you would expect from an 11 year old vehicle).  Still drives great.  Only 85,000 miles.",
5704,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,"Ok, how much are you asking?",
5705,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,I'm asking $7800.  I bought a new Escalade and no longer need this one.,

5707,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"Uh, no.  Book on it is $8300.  I'm already below that.  I'd be willing to consider an offer that is more reasonable, but $4600 is over three-thousand below my asking price.",
5708,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,0,Well to be honest I found the same care with less miles for cheaper.  If oyu are willing to throw in a warranty and deliver it for me I will offer more.,
5709,C_eb1f15e8e781463eba1aaddf70bf34e5,1,"OK, I can offer a 1 year warranty and will bring it to you, but I need you to make an offer.",

5787,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,Just under 100.  The odometer I bought with it shows 97.,
5788,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,0,Okay. Does it work well?,
5789,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,"Yes, there are no issues with the bike and it has always been kept in the garage when it isn't being ridden.",
5790,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,0,Great. That's good to know. I'm interested but 350 is a pretty steep price for a bike that's over 20 years old.,
5791,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,"Ok, well, it is in great condition, but I am willing to bargain",
5792,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,0,Okay. I can take it off your hands today for 300. I can pick it up myself.,
5793,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,I think $300 is completely reasonable.,

5924,C_63ef7a9074e44187900b6fb66037de94,1,It's less than 8 months old. No noticeable wear on it. Used for about 5 hours a week.,
5925,C_63ef7a9074e44187900b6fb66037de94,0,I feel like $175 is way too high though.,

5927,C_63ef7a9074e44187900b6fb66037de94,1,Are you looking to buy an iPad 2?,

5930,C_63ef7a9074e44187900b6fb66037de94,0,yes but I can find a used one for 150 or less.. would you be willing to do 140,

6628,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,Hello. I am very interested in the chairs. I can pay cash and pick them up for $150.00,
6629,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,1,"I can't sell them for half the asking price, sorry.  The price is firm",
6630,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,"300.00 seems a bit much, especially if I am picking them up and have cash on hand....",
6631,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,1,Delivery would be $50 extra.  Paying cash does not offer a discount,
6632,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,"yes, but I am not asking for delivery. Cash will save you money in credit card transaction fees. Let's do 200 and I can come pick them up right now",
6633,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,1,Transactions fees would be less than $5.  I will not go lower than $275.  That is lower than the normal price they sell for every day.  $275 is my final offer.,
6634,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,"unless you have stellar credit card processor, your fees will be closer to 15.00 for 275. 250, cash on hand, I pick up, and will come get them right now.",
6635,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,1,"$275 is the lowest price.  I cannot get them discounted from my supplier.  Any less, and it is not worth the sale.",
6636,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,"We are talking 25.00 here. I like the chairs, but I am not going over 250.00.",
6637,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,1,I guess we cannot make a deal then.  You will have to reject my offer.,
6638,C_0d41719afc0044b4b981cac2ddd5b1e2,0,"okay, then. good luck!",
6686,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,1,"Hey there, are you interested in the wall cabinet?",

6691,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,0,Would you be willing to take less then $50?,
6692,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,1,I was really looking for 50 but I can negotiate a little.  How much are you offering?,
6693,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,0,We just moved here so i have little funds right now. I have an extra $20 that i would love to by my daughter a gift with.,
6694,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,1,20 is way too low for me. I can let it go for 40,
6695,C_59574dd4dff1453ab3ba9db821d98b99,0,I can't do 40. I have $25,

6712,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,1,"I only use to get to work and back, so it doesn't have many miles on it at all.  It only has about 20,000 miles on it.",
6713,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,0,That's great. And is anything wrong with the interior?,
6714,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,1,The interior is in great shape.  I keep the seats covered and recently bought new covers that I will throw in if you choose to take the Nissan.,
6715,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,0,That would be awesome. Would you be willing to come down a little on the price?,
6716,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,1,I'm willing to negotiate.  How far down are you thinking?,
6717,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,0,I would love if you could come down to 7500,
6718,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,1,"I bet you would, but that's much lower than I am willing to go considering what a great car this is.  What about $9500?",
6719,C_934ad1e3bb72452ea7328e77256043e3,0,What if I buy it today and we make a deal at 9000?,

6789,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Would you be able to come down in cost?,
6790,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,Potentially.  I've always hated this carpet my wife chose to put in.  I'd come down a bit just to say that it was because of the carpeting.,
6791,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,0,Ok.  I would be a great tenant.  I could offer $2000.,

6794,C_260554825bae40c3bc5dbe3ab1b75b3e,1,"I can't offer to pay your utilities because there's no telling what that cost will be.  However, the home could easily be equipped with solar panels.  Also, it's equipped with a complete set of furnishings and appliances, though I expect you will want to bring at least some of your own.",

7270,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,"Hello, are you interested in the sofa and matching loveseat?",
7271,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,"Yea definitely, can you tell me about the condition of the sofa?",
7272,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,"They are in very good condition! No scratches or peeling. There were no pets on these couches at all, and no smoking on or around them either. I am asking $320 for the set.",
7273,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,"Nice, the only reason I ask is because i'm looking at the photo and the leather looks like it's sagging a bit. I mean it shouldn't be a huge deal but it'll cost me out of pocket to get it refitted. could you possibly accept $200 for the sofa and loveseat?",
7274,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,"They are genuine leather, and they truly are in very good condition. $200 is a bit too low. The lowest I want to go is $280.",
7275,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,What if we meet halfway on this at $240. Also would you be able to drop this off for me? I'm local but I don't have access to a pickup truck.,
7276,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,1,I am willing to do $260 with delivery included,
7277,C_f70cde3929ac49bba9fede72bd892cb1,0,What about $230 and I'll go rent a Uhaul myself? Those things are like $19 + mileage and gas.,

7294,C_16ad8add4a784396aee2749f00ab04b7,0,Oh but you drive it long distances? Like to Canada and back? That's really far.,
7295,C_16ad8add4a784396aee2749f00ab04b7,1,Yes and I drive it there 2 times a year so not too bad.,

7378,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"There are no stains, the mattress had a cover on it while in use and I have also taken the time to have it cleaned with steam and anti-bacterial cleaner solution.",
7379,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"Wow, that is awesome. I am really interested in buying the bed, but the price is a little too high for me. What is the lowest you are willing to take?",

7381,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"That is still too high for me. I am about to start at the local university, and all I have is $140 to spend",
7382,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"Oh wow, that is substantially lower than what I'd like to sell it for. If I do $140 will you help me move into my new apartment? It should only take 3 hours and I have a moving truck but nobody to help.",
7383,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,I absolutely can! sounds like a great deal!,

7525,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,I still see prices much lower than that in the area and the crime rate hasn't gone down all that much. I just checked yesterday. Can you do 1000?,
7526,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,1,"Not at all. There are far too many upgrades to let it go for that little. My Rock bottom is $1950. I put a lot of money into the granite counters, p graded fixtures and the tile in the condo.",
7527,C_232feb95232d4f0baabb7762f6742471,0,"1500 and I'll even sign a longer lease, I know that's worth something.",

7634,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,0,Can you do it for $600,
7635,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,1,600 would be way too low for me. I suppose I could knock the price down just a hair if you can get here quick. How does $1100 sound?,
7636,C_5cf2d4e054b5446891cbf147ff046c2e,0,800 and it would be going to a good home and I would really appreciate it.,

11373,C_79eebd02c22048c19beb051dbf0276ac,0,Great. What kind of mileage is it though? What kind of driving have you done with it?,
11374,C_79eebd02c22048c19beb051dbf0276ac,1,"Vehicle has had only 1 owner (myself)   purchased Mustang with only 12 miles on it.    I have only done local driving with the car,  averaging just under 2k Miles a year with it.   This is not my primary transportation.  I have kept up on the oil changes and just did a full tune up on the car 8 months ago. . .. . . purring like a kitten",
11375,C_79eebd02c22048c19beb051dbf0276ac,0,"Alright, I would like to come check it out and get a test drive. If I am able to pay cash would you consider $25000?",
11376,C_79eebd02c22048c19beb051dbf0276ac,1,"Best I will accept (cash offer)   would be an even $27,000  because a non mod  clean ass Roush Mustang is a rare find today and mine is in amazing condition and has been WELL up-kept and maintained",
11377,C_79eebd02c22048c19beb051dbf0276ac,0,Do you have a cover for it?,

11581,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,Hello,
11582,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Hello. Beautiful car!,
11583,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,"Thanks, it is a great little car.",
11584,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,What's the milage on it?,
11585,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,It only has 15k miles on it. I only drive it on weekends.,
11586,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Are you the orignal owner?,
11587,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,"Yep, I'm the only owner and I've never let anyone else drive it. I've kept up on all the maintenance and have driven it very carefully.",
11588,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Why are you parting with it?,
11589,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,I got a brand new one.,
11590,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,Nice! The price is a little steep for a 10 year old car and without warranty those german cars are expensive to work on.,
11591,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,Yeah if you don't have a good mechanic near you I guess that could be a problem. I've been lucky to have lots of great shops. I'm not in a hurry to sell it though.,
11592,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,How long is the warrranty on it?,
11593,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,I'm sure it is long expired. But I mean it is a Porshe. Not really a practical car.,
11594,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,For some it is. Would you take $40K for it?,
11595,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,No that is just way too low. This car is worth what I'm asking for it and I'm not in a hurry to sell it so I can't really justify such a low price. It's a great car in great condition. Has a Chrono sports pakage and full leather package. I can throw in the cover and a set of rims that I once bought for it but never swapped out on it. But I really can't lower the price that much.,
11596,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,0,If I was able to pick it up today would you go to $50K? I would also be paying in cash.,
11597,C_a39bea3a0f1c49bc8f233ce7a10f68a4,1,If you can pay in cash that is definitely a reasonable offer. I will be around today if you want to come check it out and give it a test drive.,

11806,C_8412f82f01c040be824397795f054c61,0,Would you be able to budge on the price to 175?,
11807,C_8412f82f01c040be824397795f054c61,1,wow that's a 100$ less. I can do 200,
11808,C_8412f82f01c040be824397795f054c61,0,200 would be fine. When we meet could you show me how to use it. I'm still using a flip phone.,

12150,C_a6b82bd32468454ca055b415aaeb3827,0,"I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out?",

13616,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,0,Im interested in the 4bedroom in Pleasanton. Is the neighborhood safe?,
13617,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,1,very safe and very good school district too. Do you have kids?,
13618,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,0,Yes I do. That is a great plus. Is it carpet or hardwood? does it have a backyard?,
13619,C_d3b6216448034cafa14a174afc6646e6,1,"Just installed new carpet all through and yes, it does have a backyard. not too big though so you dont have to worry about a whole lot of mowing! The neighbors are very nice too",

13779,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,I think that will be too low. It has all the amenities like gym and parking spot. You can save a lot of money. And there is a storage space too. Beautiful and nicely done,
13780,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,It sounds nice but some of the amenities aren't of any use to me and my preference isn't to be on the third floor.  I have a little wiggle room but not a huge amount.,
13781,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,"Ok, how about if I'll pay the bills for you?",

13784,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,"When you say bills what are you talking about?  Just utilities?  Electricity, water, gas?",
13785,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,electricity and water. We don't have gas. Good deal..,

14176,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,There wasn't really one specific thing.  She just enjoys the bed we have now.  It is in excellent condition and comes from a smoke and pet free home.,
14177,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,How many times was the bed used?,
14178,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"We basically took ours off and put this on, but she decided after a nights sleep on it, that she preferred ours better.",
14179,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Is it the latest model?,
14180,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"Yes..  Cost well over $2,000..",
14181,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,
14182,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"I just want it out of here.  I figured if I asked more than that, that it wouldn't sell quickly.  I don't have the space to continue to store it and I will deliver for free..",
14183,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Okay that makes sense. I will take it off your hands for $500,
14184,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,Awesome.. Thx.  You will love it!,

14226,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,0,Yeah I saw that but it is a used bike and I don't know who had it before you and how good they took care of it.  Also you could have the cash in your hand today and I would be glad to come pick it up and load it myself,
14227,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,1,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price.",
14228,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,0,"Well people may be hesitant to buy with you selling it so soon, they might wonder why you want to get rid of it?  I can do $1000 cash and I'll pick up!",

14457,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Yes I am.  It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,
14458,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.,

14460,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.,
14461,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Did a child play with it?,
14462,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.,
14463,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"May I ask, why are you selling it?",
14464,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price.",
14465,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking.  Will you take $90?,
14466,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal.",

14468,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra.",
14469,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Well then $150 seems reasonable.  I can manage that.,

17761,C_9409f4d8aa774230b37c883f29c73207,1,The price is pretty much firm but we could possibly trade. I'm looking for a Honda Generator. You have one?,
17762,C_9409f4d8aa774230b37c883f29c73207,0,Unfortunately I do not. How about if I agree to pick up the lights in my truck you agree to lower the price to $900. I could be there today cash in hand.,
17763,C_9409f4d8aa774230b37c883f29c73207,1,I only have one and am asking $675. If you want to pay me $900 I'll take it!,

17813,C_45db1e1be6d04ba59061fd26fb312eef,0,Wow that seems to be a great deal. But i am just curious do you have your Dad's permission to sell the Phone,
17814,C_45db1e1be6d04ba59061fd26fb312eef,1,"Absolutely I do. He's not very tech savvy, so he asked me to sell it for him. Like I said in the listing, it's in excellent condition, with only a scuff near the charging port (probably from him trying to plug it in in the dark, haha). We're looking to sell it for $450, but I'm willing to negotiate on the price.",

17819,C_45db1e1be6d04ba59061fd26fb312eef,0,"No charger, No head Phone. I guess i will spend up to $30 to get those. $320 will be ideal. What about $320 then",

18280,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,I think that will be too low. It has all the amenities like gym and parking spot. You can save a lot of money. And there is a storage space too. Beautiful and nicely done,
18281,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,It sounds nice but some of the amenities aren't of any use to me and my preference isn't to be on the third floor. I have a little wiggle room but not a huge amount.,

18286,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,electricity and water. We don't have gas. Good deal..,
18287,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,0,I'll do $1450 plus electricity and water.,
18288,C_322ca5e93e114b06a61dcf0742ba9ac9,1,Ok.. But you have to move in this month.,

18831,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"We basically took ours off and put this on, but she decided after a nights sleep on it, that she preferred ours better.",

18833,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"Yes.. Cost well over $2,000..",
18834,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,
18835,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,"I just want it out of here. I figured if I asked more than that, that it wouldn't sell quickly. I don't have the space to continue to store it and I will deliver for free..",
18836,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,0,Okay that makes sense. I will take it off your hands for $500,
18837,C_2a7e7681bd3a484bbcaa3390726e6d79,1,Awesome.. Thx. You will love it!,

18884,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,0,Yes what shape are the tires in? Also how is the paint on the body,
18885,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,1,"It is in great condition, nice and clean. The paint and tires are perfect. It is only 6months old",

18887,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,1,"Well as the ad says, the price is pretty firm at $1350 ...",
18888,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,0,Yeah I saw that but it is a used bike and I don't know who had it before you and how good they took care of it. Also you could have the cash in your hand today and I would be glad to come pick it up and load it myself,
18889,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,1,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price.",

18907,C_b1e59181c2b94a979661b006273c7146,1,It is a tire conversion kit. It helps to maintain your tire and ensure it has longer lifetime,
18908,C_b1e59181c2b94a979661b006273c7146,0,Do you not need it anymore?,

18978,C_d01f1a8e4db54f898c9c3f528fa26754,0,Are there a lot of kids in the complex or is it more older people?,
18979,C_d01f1a8e4db54f898c9c3f528fa26754,1,It is more for older people. Quiet and serene,

19126,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Hi! I see you are interested in my tablet.,
19127,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Yes I am. It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,
19128,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.,
19129,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Does it come with a warranty?,
19130,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.,
19131,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Did a child play with it?,
19132,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.,
19133,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"May I ask, why are you selling it?",
19134,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price.",
19135,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking. Will you take $90?,
19136,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal.",
19137,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"If you can ship it to me and include those accessories, I can go to $125 paid immediately.",
19138,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra.",
19139,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Well then $150 seems reasonable. I can manage that.,
19140,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Ok. I guess so.,
19141,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"Okay then it's a deal -- $150 shipped with accessories,",

19190,C_1db947fa206d43dcb9aa44c447b364f1,1,I cannot lie to you. I do not know what sort of things you like? What activities or places do you find good for instance?,
19191,C_1db947fa206d43dcb9aa44c447b364f1,0,"You should have it on the listing, what stores are nearby, how close to the nearest school or playground so I know how noisy it is, etc.",
19192,C_1db947fa206d43dcb9aa44c447b364f1,1,"I totally understand where you are coming from, but unfortunately I'm only able to talk to you about the description of the home. I invite you to come and take a look at the place yourself and see what facilities this side of town offers.",
19193,C_1db947fa206d43dcb9aa44c447b364f1,0,Yeahhh that's super weird. That makes me think the neighborhood is really run down and sketchy....,

21086,C_e16cf81527b6460f90fabbdffdf16d34,1,Awesome!! It's a great bike and I haven't had it for a long time so it's in pretty new condition,
21087,C_e16cf81527b6460f90fabbdffdf16d34,0,Is it a street bike?,
21088,C_e16cf81527b6460f90fabbdffdf16d34,1,yes I use it to commute to work so I avoid driving my car,

21106,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,How much are you looking to get for it? It's near my new job and I'd love to be able to live close to my work.,

21108,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,That's cool. $2025 is still more than I was wanting to spend. Do you allow roomates/sub leasing? That would help bring down the cost for me?,
21109,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,"Yes, you can use the other room as a bedroom. The place is big, so there is still a kitchen, dining and and a living room to hang out in.",
21110,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,Great. Is there any wiggle room on the price? Any chance I could do $1700/month for the first 6 months and then up to the full price of $2025 for the last 6 months? That would give me time to find a rooomate.,
21111,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,1,1800 and we'll have a deal. I could give you a month to pay if you pay the deposit up front.,
21112,C_82b4463df03d4d53b1b94e69559eca55,0,That works for me! Thanks!,
