932,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,Hi there. I'm trying to get rid of this armoire as soon as possible.,
933,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,The armoire looks pretty nice.,
934,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,It's in pretty good condition.  The handle on the right door is missing. That's the only thing wrong with it.,
935,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,I'm sure it will take time and money to replace the handle.  I would like to pay $30.,
936,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,The handle doesnt cost much to replace.  Home depot has something similar for cheap. How about 35?,
937,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,"I hope you're correct, but it will still take some time. I will also need to get it installed, I'm not good with tools.  Let's make it 32 dollars.",
938,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,"Okay, you have a point. 33 and it's a deal.",
939,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,I will agree to $33 if you can deliver it.,
940,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,Delivery? That's a bit extra. I would expect you to come pick it up.,
941,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,"I don't have a vehicle.  I would have to rent something.  I will cost much more.  If I have to pick it up, I will pay $30.  If you deliver it, I will pay you $35.",
942,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,1,I'll deliver it and accept the 35,
943,C_2c986b1c12414614ac57c10bd58ec56b,0,"Great, $35 with delivery.",
1145,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,"Hello, glad you are interested in the townhouse. Are there any questions I can answer for you?",
1146,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,"Yeah, I was wondering if the townhome came with any appliances?",
1147,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,All appliances are included - except washer and dryer.,
1148,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,Are there any rules on smoking? Or pets?,
1149,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,"Pets OK. They complete a family. I would say smoking outside is acceptable, but please be courteous and keep the grounds clean.",
1150,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,"I understand that. It seems like a pretty nice place. But without a washer and dryer available on the property, I was wondering if there may be some wiggle room price wise?",
1151,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,I feel we could go down to 1650. The savings could go towards purchasing your own washer/dryer unit.,
1152,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,"1650 is a pretty good start, but I was thinking, since I had to purchase a new washer and dryer would could do something like 1368?",
1153,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,"There are many benifits to this unit that I think you would find agreeable. We offer 24/7 maintenance, and a satisfaction guarantee. With all the townhouse has to offer you can see the value. Could we meet in the middle at 1580?",
1154,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,"I do like the 24/7 maintenance, if you were able to do an even 1500 I would be happy to make this deal.",
1155,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,1,I can go as low $1550 ... and if we go ahead and lock that price in and start the application now we will waive the $30 application fee.,
1156,C_26a17a9bd6754463b0ce7b4db02c3f78,0,Agreed,
1181,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,Are you interested in the bookcase?,
1182,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,I think I am interested,
1183,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,I'm asking $95 or best offer,
1184,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,Do you have a return policy?,
1185,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,"No, this is a private resell item.  You can check it out at Yesteryears Marketplace Antique Store if you like",
1186,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,"oh, ok, do you offer a warranty of any sort?",
1187,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,Cash and carry.  You pickup.,
1188,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,I'm thinking $30 is a fair price,
1189,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,It cost me $30 to bring it here.  I can't accept anything less than $75.,
1190,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,"Well, $45 means you still get a pretty good profit. How about that?",
1191,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,"This is  a 6' tall, oak wook bookcase with 2 glass doors and shelves on the interior.  $75, take it or leave it.",
1192,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,I know it is a great bookcase but it isn't new. It is used. That should make it cheaper...,
1193,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,"I've dropped the price by $20 so if you want it it will cost you $75, if you don't I need to check someone else who wants to pay my original asking price.  Do you want it at $75?",
1194,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,That is just way more then I am willing pay. I can go up to $65,
1195,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,"Sorry, no deal.  I cannot accept anything less than $75 and I'm not willing to go any lower.",
1196,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,0,"ok, I can't go any higher",
1197,C_e18fde101d66486f8a9294b95f223c8a,1,Alright.  Have a nice day!,
1208,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,How many hours have you used this for?,
1209,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,Probably 24.  It's just too big for my small wrist so that's why I'm selling it.,
1210,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,can you ship it to me,
1211,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,I can ship it to you if you pay what I'm asking for it.  $150,
1212,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,it sells list price for 150. I could just get it on amazon with free shipping for that price brand new,
1213,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,Well???,
1214,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,"well if you aren't willing to sell it less than list price for a used watch, then I don't think we can come to an agreement",
1215,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,"I wouldn't call 24 hours used, but if you want to forego the agreement that's okay.",
1216,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,I mean you need to get rid of the watch as it's currently useless to you. I'm willing to give you 130,
1217,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,I have to pay for shipping which I would naturally insure it for it's value so I'm firm on $150,
1218,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,You will never be able to sell it at the same price of a brand new watch. $138 is my final offer,
1219,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,1,"I'll accept $143, again I have to pay for shipping.",
1220,C_14a829b7d2274ff79407611383d91ff5,0,I can't go above 138. I think an 8% depreciation is fair for a used and open product,

1254,C_bc3bdc71428c42b98631c73a6baec3c5,0,I was hoping to get it closer to 360...,
1255,C_bc3bdc71428c42b98631c73a6baec3c5,1,Wow that's pretty low for a limited edition. I think it might be fare to meet you half way. The lowest I can absolutely go is 600 final offer,

1625,C_fbda443162bc473d80e342f9d32ce050,1,"Ok, I can live with that.",

1775,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,0,"Hi, i am interested in the Sofa i was wondering if there are any major stains?",
1776,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,1,"No stains at all, this was in my guest room/office and only used a couple times",
1777,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,0,Smoke free/ Pet free home?,
1778,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,1,Yes,
1779,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,0,is it already disassemebeld or ready to be shipped/picked up?,
1780,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,1,It isn't at the moment but it only take about 10 minutes to be disassembled so I can have it ready by the time you are here to pick it up,
1781,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,0,I would like to offer you 20$ for it and I will come and dissasemble it and pick it up. I will also bring enough help to lift it.,
1782,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,1,"The lowest Im willing to go is $30, its practically new",
1783,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,0,How about 22 dollars and I will bring you free smoke detectors for your residence from my job ? Each detector has a ten year battery so you wont have to worry about changing the batteries for a long time.,
1784,C_1b12edbf87074d38b5cfbd23892cd178,1,That sounds fair,
1795,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Hi. I'm interested in buying your end tables.,
1796,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,Great.  You'll love the table it is very high quality.,
1797,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Oh? Is there something special about the item that makes it stand out?,
1798,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"Yes, they are made of high quality oak.",
1799,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,That sounds fantastic. What condition are they in? Any scuffs or marks on them?,
1800,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,They are in good condition.  I could sell one to you for $150.00,
1801,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,Any wiggle room there? They really do look fantastic but I'm on a budget. I could pick them up myself for a discount.,
1802,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,I could come down a little if you picked them up. What would you be willing to offer?,
1803,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,"I could offer you 100 dollars cash, tonight.",
1804,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"That might be a little lower than I can take for the table.  If you were able to pick it up and give me $140 cash, I'd do it.",
1805,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,That's a bit too high for me sadly. But because they are such high quality I would be willing to stretch myself. How about we meet in the middle? 125 and I take it off your hands tonight? What do you say? Really can't afford any higher.,
1806,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,"You get what you pay for.  I promise you will love this table.  I can come down from my original price, but I still have to get a fair price for the table.  If you can do 129, I'll do the deal.",
1807,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,"I understand that, but since I'm offering a fast easy deal, cash, an picking it up myself I do think that 125 is fair. It saves you the gas. Plus that is honestly all I have on me. I love the item but I can't go borrowing money to buy it.",
1808,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,1,I really want to do the deal with you.  How about $125 cash and you mow my lawn tonight.  That way you don't have to borrow money and I'll get a fair price for the table.,
1809,C_df7312b796ed4e0a94a9f8bf91c82a6c,0,As long as it's a small one I guess I could do that.,

1829,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,"would you be willing to take $650.00 cash money, today? I will pick up immediatly!",
1830,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,1,"That is a good offer, It would be great if you could pick it up , but 650 is a bit too far below asking price. I could go as low as 700 though.",
1831,C_dbbc4fe3949f4926b4da27cb01b2c3da,0,I will take it for $700.00,

1838,C_738fdd3861e047a383d92779e21f4b4c,0,"Yes I am. Will it hold a 55"" tv?",
1839,C_738fdd3861e047a383d92779e21f4b4c,1,I believe so.,
1840,C_738fdd3861e047a383d92779e21f4b4c,0,Will you take $60 for it?,
1841,C_738fdd3861e047a383d92779e21f4b4c,1,"That is too low, I could come down to $75.",
1842,C_738fdd3861e047a383d92779e21f4b4c,0,I can do that.,
2139,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,Hello! Are you interested in the leather sofa?,
2140,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Yes, I might be. Are there any problems with the sofa?",
2141,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,Absolutely none! I've only owned it for one year and it is in absolutely pristine condition.,
2142,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, if it's in such great condition, why are you getting rid of it?",
2143,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"You see, I just got a new kitten for my daughter. They are absolutely inseparable! But this sofa is a (hard to come by) light grey Italian leather and the kitten unfortunately sheds a LOT. I just don't like how it looks in the living room anymore and it is difficult to keep hair-free. Not to worry, I'm having it professionally cleaned to remove all pet dander!",
2144,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, if this kitten is such a burden, I'd be glad to take it off your hands for $225.",
2145,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"Since it is being cleaned and it is a very high quality leather, much less in a rare shade of grey, I would be willing to take 325 for it.",
2146,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Well, now I'm interested in this kitten too. I'll tell you what, if you throw in the kitten, I'll take the sofa a $375.",
2147,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,1,"Oh no no, I cannot part with the kitten. She is family. But she did come from a litter that still has kittens available from. She is a high quality breed. I can give you the contact info. The owner is a dear friend of mine and I can get her to give you an excellent deal on the kitten. I can take 300 for the sofa",
2148,C_d1f5f5ccae3d4e518bb32354e619d0b3,0,"Okay, I'll take the sofa for $300.",
2162,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,Hello.,
2163,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Yes, hello, are these two pieces of furniture in good condition?",
2164,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,"I would say they are in excellent condition. The covers on the cushions shrunk after we put them in the wash, but other than that there is no wear and tear on the furniture.",
2165,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,What sort of fabric is on the rest of the chair?,
2166,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,The arms and support are made out of seagrass.,
2167,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Okay, well, I suppose I could get some fabric and sew some new seat covers. In light of the work I'd have to put in, I'd be willing to go as high as $500.",
2168,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I'm sorry. I cannot go that low. I need to make at least $1150 off of these items.,
2169,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"I have to provide pickup, and make the covers, there's no way I could go anywhere near that high. I could see $550, that's definitely what I'd like to pay.",
2170,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I could make by with 800$ but I can't get rid of them with that low of a price. I paid way too much for these pieces and I would experience substantial loss.,
2171,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Well, at $800 I'd need some other perks to even consider it.",
2172,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,What do you have in mind?,
2173,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Well, what can you offer me?",
2174,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,I can offer you a computer desk to go with it. It's not in great condition but It's wide and has a tower cabinet.,
2175,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,0,"Okay, I guess $800 is the price.",
2176,C_1efe9e7bdc0c4f0a95f6d2f69d714061,1,Thank you.,
2210,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,how are you?,
2211,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,Good thank you. I would like to buy your truck.,
2212,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"Sounds good, make me an offer",
2213,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,Would you take $2000 for it?,
2214,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"I'm sorry, I can't go that low.  Can you come up a bit?",
2215,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,What about $2500?,
2216,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,I was hoping to get at least $3200 for it.,
2217,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,I can go up to $3000 and that would be my final offer.,
2218,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,1,"I can do $3000, that seems fair.",
2219,C_80b5ff3d52714bb0a50809399b32e3b7,0,"Ok, $3000 it is.",
2307,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Hello.  How are you,
2308,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,I'm fine. I'd be a lot better if I could rent this house in your listing.,
2309,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Oh yeah?  WHat do you like about it,
2310,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, the 3 baths seems nice, and I like the square footage.",
2311,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,Yeah it's really good for the price.  I'm looking for serious renters,
2312,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I'm a serious renter, but I don't think this price is very serious.",
2313,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,How so?,
2314,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, it seems a little steep. I was thinking something more in the range of $1500",
2315,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"That is impossible.  How about $1900 a month, for two years minimum?",
2316,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I already located this home from a satellite interpolation based on the shadow length, and I know what neighborhood it's in. This isn't the sort of neighborhood that I'd be willing to rent for that much money.",
2317,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"You're right, $2100.  It's extremely clean",
2318,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"It's right next to the Tracy sports complex, in Tracy California. I practically expect to GET paid if I'm moving to California for some reason???",
2319,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,You're the one who messaged me buddy,
2320,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Well, I just saw the beautiful photo of the home, and now I feel like I've been bait and switched! I don't want to move to 2487 Graystone Drive, in Tracy California, not unless I can get a great deal.",
2321,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"Alright, $2000 then",
2322,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Look, I guess if you'll throw in 6 live marijuana plants, I'll consider it a done deal.",
2323,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,1,"SUre, they'll be there when you arrive",
2324,C_ffb4922be9be4e3b9f09bbebe261e94e,0,"Okay, great.",
2356,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,Hello. Are you interested in my bike?,
2357,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,0,Is that the actual picture of the bike?,

2360,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,"Not exactly, but it should work for kids around 3 ft tall",
2361,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,0,Does it have a hand brake or a brake on the pedal?,
2362,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,Hand brake,
2363,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,0,Warranty still available?,

2368,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,"Yes, for our purposes. Sure.",
2369,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,0,I would like to make an offer.  The color isn't what I was interested and I really would prefer a foot versus hand brake for safety.  Do you have any flexiblility on your price?,
2370,C_7f393ad9c05e43d4a0b2ed3422302509,1,"Please do make an offer. I have some flexibility, but not much.",
2371,C_6de63527ca804412916bd54f9f62ddb1,1,"Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but you look like you could use a home.",
2372,C_6de63527ca804412916bd54f9f62ddb1,0,"Well, it all depends on the price, I suppose.",
2373,C_6de63527ca804412916bd54f9f62ddb1,1,What would you be willing to spend on a well maintain place?,
2374,C_6de63527ca804412916bd54f9f62ddb1,0,"Well, I used a proprietary satellite imaging system to determine the latitude and longitude of the location of where the photo was taken and I'm going over floor plans for these apartments now.",

2440,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,It is!  It has been totally updated with lots of upgrades.  It is in an excellent location only minutes away from several schools.  It includes all appliances except the fridge.,
2441,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,"I have pets, but I don't really want to pay extra. Is this feasible?",
2442,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,What kind of pets do you have?,
2443,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,"2 cats,but they are litter box trained and they spend a lot of time outdoors.",

2446,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,"Ok, great.  I think I could work with you on waiving the pet deposit, as long as I could check your current or past landlords references pertaining to the pets, that no damage was caused by them.",
2447,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,Thank you. That sounds fine to me. If I were to go ahead and sign a 2 year lease instead of just 1 would you be able to drop the price down to $3000?,
2448,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,Would you be able to pay the deposit in full ?,

2450,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,1,"Ok, Great!  So, just to reiterate, you would sign a 2 year lease agreement at $3,000 per month and pay a $3,000 security deposit.  The pet deposit will be waived upon satisfactory reference check with current and previous landlords.",
2451,C_03a08109ea894ddf9e5df58a99c107b2,0,Sounds perfect!,

2676,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,Hello,
2677,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"Good morning, how are you?",
2678,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Great, how about yourself?",
2679,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,Doing well. You're interested in my ad for the BMW X5? It's a great looking vehicle with only 117k miles on it.,
2680,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Yeah, I was looking around and it caught my eye. I would be willing to pay $5400 for it right now. I have the cash and could make the payment today. Of course, I would like to take a look at it first and possible take it for a test spin.",
2681,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"Understood. I'm asking $9,000 for it at the moment. We could definitely arrange for a test drive, but I don't think I can be that flexible on the price.",
2682,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"Hmm, well I think the asking price is too steep considering the year and the car having 117k miles on it. I just bought a 2011 VW GTI with 56k on it for 9,000. I think I can go up to around $6,500 for this BWM. Anything more is too much in my opinion.",
2683,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"So while it's a 2006 model, it is a rather large BMW sports utility vehicle.  Luxury SUVs hold their value well and BMW doesn't change their styling much from year to year. I could go $8,000.",
2684,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"I don't think I can do $8,000.",
2685,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"Well, this is a great looking vehicle, it was just cleaned and detailed and is really ready to go.",
2686,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,"How about $7,000?",
2687,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,1,"I could split the difference and do $7,500.",
2688,C_a1d63481c56c4f55b930400d9d367e58,0,Deal! <puts hand out for a shake>,

2812,C_4fa38f0561b54c0b8885dc1b16cc23c4,1,"I meant to say fairly new because I used them once, 120 is too low, I can go down to 190 final",
2813,C_4fa38f0561b54c0b8885dc1b16cc23c4,0,Ok but it doesn't come with an amp which means I would have to buy one,

2819,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"I'm interested in finding a tenant for the apartment, are you interested in it?",
2820,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Hi. Yes. Thank you. I am interested in your apartment. Is heat included?,
2821,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"No, but I do pay water and garbage.  You'll need to furnish your electric",
2822,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Is there carpeting or wood floors?,
2823,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,It has wood floors throughout but carpeting in the bedrooms.  There is an electric heat pump that works great,
2824,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Okay. About the heat? How much is a typical heating bill during the winter months for this space?,
2825,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"It will depend on your use but I'd say 80-110 is average, bearing in mind it's a large townhome",
2826,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Okay. I was looking at a townhome a few blocks away. They offer free heat and have a big bath with jacuzzi jets. What kind of tub or shower does your place have?,
2827,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,It has a very nice garden tub and shower upstairs and then a half bath downstairs.  Both are newly updated and have new tiles and flooring,
2828,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,I noticed that you are located by a drug-testing facility for recently that is frequented by people on probation and parolees. I am very concerned about that.,
2829,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"Yes I understand that, but we do have a security system in place in the unit that you can activate for a small monthly fee.  I'm asking $1800 for the apartment but I can do $1700 to adjust for the heating cost if that would suit you",
2830,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,I am willing to offer you $1500. I think that is a fair price for the location,
2831,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,1,"Okay, I will accept that offer.",
2832,C_12a45dc2788843838ad9b231f03bd3fb,0,Excellent. See you later.,

2837,C_7346d2b98c44463a94985811bf8b8b43,0,Let's negotiate! I see that you are selling this couch. I like it but I need to know if there is anything wrong with it. Is it sagging anywhere? Any bad smells or stains?,

2886,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,It just means that it is handmade and so that light still shines through the joints. The table is in amazing condition and is a handmade piece.,
2887,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"It's a little small for what you're asking and there's no warranty on it, would you be willing to take $270 for the table?",
2888,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,1,"The price is firm, I have a little wiggle room, but I couldn't go that low. It is well priced for being a handmade piece.",
2889,C_cb41c015c9fa47b2b74d7869c934d470,0,"Well I understand that, but I'm comparing it to several others that I'm considering and it's significantly more expensive.  How about if I come pick it up, would you let it go for $350?",

That's still a bit steep for me but...well...I really like that it is made from largely recycled materials. How about $600? By the way can this couch be easily dissasembled for transport?

3534,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,1,"If you factor in the price of a moving truck with my offer it is a steal!You'd be paying less with my deal,but since I feel you truly love this couch I will drop it down to $800 and still provide my additional services!",
3535,C_356d5a4c9c6749ceb43622f51895db41,0,"Well...that is more than I can comfortably pay but it is a very attractive couch and since you're offering to set it up, I will accept your offer of $800.",

4696,C_4925e3cf03124a1c9b5d7aaf38714909,0,"That's way more than I wanted to pay.  It's almost 10 years old. While it's a great car, I wouldn't pay more than $12,500.",

4810,C_e5d731de606e46d693b0ef262d88510c,0,"That's definitely a plus!  My wife is an avid biker and I want to surprise her with a nice bike.  Something like this would normally be way out of my price range.  But, I figured I would give it a try.",

4913,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"Don't have to worry about late nights or problems from me. I'm going to school full time and working 20 hours a week, so won't even be there much. Would you be willing to go down to $1,100?",
4914,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"Oh, that sounds like a very busy schedule. With $1100, I don't think I would be able to cover the cost of utilities. Did you see that they were fully included? If you are able to sign a lease today, I could do $1275",
4915,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,"I'd be willing to work a few hours of maintenance each week if you could go $1,150. That's as high as I can go.",

4918,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,1,"How about 1250. You are responsible for 6 hours of work a month assigned by the property manager. That works out to a rate of about $25.00 discount, but you would be responsible for paying the full balance if you are not able to complete the work. If you are a good employee, I think we could consider additional hours,and further reduction after a trial period.",
4919,C_41e2a5cc40e5447bb5d62f3be9040bef,0,I just don't think I can afford that.,

4926,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,0,Since there seems to be alot of unknowns with this item would you be willing to accept $322?,
4927,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,1,I would be willing to take $25 off the original price of $350 to cover the unknowns.,
4928,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,1,Making the purchase price $325 and I will include free shipping.,
4929,C_3fa8726d330440bb8ace32ba5595999a,0,That sounds like a fair trade to me.,

5232,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,Okay. That's good to hear. What do you think about $5000 even for it. Of course you know that you priced it a bit high.,
5233,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,1,I researched and that is more than fair market value. I am willing to lower it but feel 5000 is too low.,
5234,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,"Well, it's a used car without a warranty. I can go a little bit higher than 5k, but I need a warranty.",

5236,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,What's the warranty? I don't see it in your advertisement,
5237,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,1,"It is a manufacturer warranty, good for 5 more years..",
5238,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,0,"Okay, well in that case, I feel quite a bit better about the fact that there aren't any pictures. How about an even 6000? I am going up a whole thousand more than I want to pay here, please budge for me!!!",
5239,C_3c44ab824f224d94928edb943215b3fd,1,alright for you I can do 6000.,

5319,C_88a63f6ffc7a4126a8a942274eee179c,0,I could go $2500 if you can include a washer/dryer but that's the best I can do.,

5389,C_0c5a4ef3672b4c829679e3621c131ea4,1,"That is a little low, I understand it needs some things. I would drop the priced to $1,000.",
5390,C_0c5a4ef3672b4c829679e3621c131ea4,0,"I just can't pay that much, it isn't worth it. How about $775?",
5391,C_0c5a4ef3672b4c829679e3621c131ea4,1,If you can pick it up today and pay cash I would take $850.,

5637,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,"That's right. It's mine only, and I've owned for about a few months give or take, so it's not in the worst condition at all. How much are we willing to negotiate?",
5638,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,0,"Well, $800 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $650 if I were to come and pick it up?  Might save you a little bit of hassle....",
5639,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,That s a lot lower than I hoped it would be. I want to sell it for $775 because of how close it is to that of a brand new bike in terms of quality.,
5640,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,0,Hmmm....How about $725?,
5641,C_ecd38bebdde84cc48aee2ae5214e4ba8,1,"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?",

5787,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,Just under 100.  The odometer I bought with it shows 97.,
5788,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,0,Okay. Does it work well?,
5789,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,"Yes, there are no issues with the bike and it has always been kept in the garage when it isn't being ridden.",
5790,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,0,Great. That's good to know. I'm interested but 350 is a pretty steep price for a bike that's over 20 years old.,
5791,C_b512167e21b84e95be33990a2a008ea6,1,"Ok, well, it is in great condition, but I am willing to bargain",

5914,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,1,I'd really like to get at least 45 for it. It is in mint condition. I can deliver it wherever you like.,
5915,C_0c89944545eb4ef783300208ecb750c8,0,No problem picking it up if you are nearby. I'd go that high only if you included on eof the Alpines. I can go $30 if you help install it in my car.,

5987,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,0,Would these be ok for looking at my neighbors? I think those kids are up to no good.,
5988,C_46a08a196c644ecd84a1dd9bc747cd9d,1,Yes and you can even hook up to wifi and works in night too,

6092,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Yes. What kind of condition is it in and does it have any mechanical problems?,
6093,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,It's in really great condition. It has 106k miles but these are mostly highway miles so the engine runs like it's lower miles than that.,
6094,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Okay then. The price is a little high are you willing to negotiate?,
6095,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,I can negotiate a little bit but that's really a pretty reasonable price already. What were you thinking?,
6096,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Are you willing to go down to 8000?,
6097,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,"No that is way too low, it's worth much more than that. How about 13500?",
6098,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,That is too high. I don't think it's worth that much given the mileage. How about 10500,
6099,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,1,Since the engine is in really good condition that would really be too low. 12500 is the lowest I can go.,
6100,C_8ea0753dc2ed45d9be560e1d559cca11,0,Okay that sounds fair.,
6208,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,"Hi, I had asked for a phone number in my ad, but suppose we can chat here instead.",

6213,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,0,A new one actually goes for a little bit less. How about $5 for it,
6214,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,that is far too low. this is fair market value price at 18 I am willing to come down to $15.,

6216,C_fb9b2093cc4e4cac8189fb8836015dec,1,No I am sorry that is too big a loss for me. I would do 13.50 but that is my ultimate final low price.,

6248,C_ab38adbebe6f44f0bc7dcd3ed4795591,0,I just am not sure I can really afford that at the moment. Is there any possible way to go a little bit lower?,
6249,C_ab38adbebe6f44f0bc7dcd3ed4795591,1,"I might be able to find you a discount. Are you a student, senior or military person?",

6384,C_75fe999d6407454fb1f2d5b6f03d231a,1,It is not used a lot. I only used it a couple of times but I just don't use it anymore so that is why I'm selling it. It's in pretty great shape.,

7125,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,"No, I don't own any other cushions but these.",
7126,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,"ok, how much do they cost",
7127,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,They're $250,
7128,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,"how about 220, because they are only offered in red",
7129,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,"Since they're only 3 years old and barely used, why don't we meet at $235?",
7130,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,I feel more like $225,
7131,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,Why is that?,
7132,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,because they are used and 3 years old,
7133,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,I purchased them for $400.  $235 is a great deal,
7134,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,"right, but I cannot fully see the condition of the second chair",
7135,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,I'm sorry.  I cannot go lower than $235.,
7136,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,ok fine then we are in agreement $235,
7137,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,1,"Ok, I'm glad we could agree.  I'll have it ready for you to pick up tomorrow.",
7138,C_e2e9afd03c494833b88eae49798934da,0,"thank you, Have a great day",
7258,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,Hi! You were interested in the Ranger?,
7259,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"It looks nice, but I really don't think it's worth what you're asking.",
7260,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"How come? It was very well maintained through our company, everything runs perfect on it. Just like new.",
7261,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,It's 6 years old and that mileage seems high. If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time,
7262,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever.",
7263,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000",
7264,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you.",
7265,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty",
7266,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back!",
7267,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,0,"Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer.",
7268,C_0c9f9c0132ca49fd802a829a72e84457,1,"If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount. I'll pend you an offer. Think about it. Thank you for your time either way!",
7312,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,Hello. Are you still selling the bike?,
7313,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"I've had a few offers, but I'm willing to see what you have to say",
7314,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,How old is the bike and what kind of condition is it in?,
7315,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"It's a vintage, so it has a great personality!  Haha it's actually in great condition, I was never really able to use it much",
7316,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,Okay and it has also been repainted right?,
7317,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"Yes, I got it professionally done",
7318,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,That's good but with the original paint it would be worth more. Would you sell it for 140?,
7319,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"That's pretty low.  Even sanded down, this bike is worth 190.  Lowest I can go is 200 with what I put into it already (mods and painting)",
7320,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,0,"Modifying it actually decreases the value too, customizing something makes it worth less you don't just add on the cost of custom parts. That takes away any value it had as a vintage item.",
7321,C_7992ab588e6c4495bd471a0dfd2a47ba,1,"Hmm, well it sounds like you probably aren't interested then.  As a non-vintage bike, it's worth 200.  The vintage should add on to it.  Lowest I'll go is 180 if you pick it up.",
7354,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,Hi I am interested in the car you have for sale.  How many miles are on it and is there anything wrong with it?,
7355,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"There's some kind of misfire in the engine I was told it has a dead cylinder, that should be the only issue.",
7356,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,oh ouch and how many miles are on it?,
7357,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,It only has about 66k miles on it.,
7358,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,Well with that problem and the hassle it is going to be to get it registered in the US I could only really offer you $2000 for it.  If I have to replace the motor that is going to cost a fortune.,
7359,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"You don't have to replace the whole engine, I already lowered the price considering the repair cost. Other than the repair it is still pretty new and has a lot of mileage left in it.",
7360,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,"Well I will tell you what, I can do 3,500 but that is only after I have my mechanic look at it.  There is still the hassle of getting it registered here.",
7361,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"Look I can bring it down to 6500 if that helps you out but you might be looking for a way cheaper car, this one might be out of your price range",
7362,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,I'll tell you what I can do 5000 but you have to deliver it to me.  And no it's not too expensive for me I just really don't need it just like it.,
7363,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,1,"6400 and that's my final offer, and you come to pick it up.",
7364,C_f6892a39e6da4ba08be0a94baa7ad872,0,keep it have a nice day,
7365,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,1,Are you interested in my phone case?,
7366,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,0,Yes would you be willing to lower the price to $10?,
7367,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,1,I cannot go that low.  Could you do $15?,
7368,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,0,I have cash in hand and I can pick it up today. The highest I can go is $12.,
7369,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,1,Sorry I cannot go any lower than $15.,
7370,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,0,Can you meet me half way so I don't have to drive so far? I can do $15 then.,
7371,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,1,Where are you located?,
7372,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,0,I'm in Downtown,
7373,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,1,Awesome.  I have somewhere to be in that area later today so we can meet up.,
7374,C_c0af7798dc2441069c9d910b208bfec5,0,Ok great. Let's meet at 4PM. $15 thanks my man,
7375,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"Hi, I see you have a mattress, box spring and frame for sale! can you tell me more about the condition of the items>",
7376,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"Yes, I sure can! They are all in excellent condition for being used for two years. There is no damage except the frame is missing a floor coaster.",
7377,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"Great, so no stains, correct?",
7378,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"There are no stains, the mattress had a cover on it while in use and I have also taken the time to have it cleaned with steam and anti-bacterial cleaner solution.",
7379,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"Wow, that is awesome. I am really interested in buying the bed, but the price is a little too high for me. What is the lowest you are willing to take?",
7380,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"If you can pick it up, I will drop that price to $250 just for you. Are you also interested in the free sheets and comforter?",
7381,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,"That is still too high for me. I am about to start at the local university, and all I have is $140 to spend",
7382,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"Oh wow, that is substantially lower than what I'd like to sell it for. If I do $140 will you help me move into my new apartment? It should only take 3 hours and I have a moving truck but nobody to help.",
7383,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,0,I absolutely can! sounds like a great deal!,
7384,C_7027cba70a0c465591824bda831bbb3b,1,"Wow, awesome!",

7408,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,Lol. I hope I didn't offend. It's just that the truck is pretty cool so I figured you for the Willie Nelson type.,
7409,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,1,"You're not too far off. And yes the truck is a classic, mostly original too, other than the exhaust and a bit of tuning on the engine.",
7410,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,"Excellent. That's just what I wanted to hear. I have $5,000 cash, how does that sound?",
7411,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,1,That's quite a bit lower than I was looking for. Can you do you $5750?,
7412,C_55d92c7b2a364ba1be0e1adff51cfdfd,0,Hmmmm. How's the interior?,

7436,C_b7418e0ecf9e4fa3802abbf41474db22,1,I can come down to 220 but you have to get both of them.,
7437,C_b7418e0ecf9e4fa3802abbf41474db22,0,There is no way that I can go that high.  I only have 200 to my name until next week.  I can do 150 for both.  I really need these because I don't have any furniture at all and these would be perfect.,
7438,C_b7418e0ecf9e4fa3802abbf41474db22,1,If you only want one I can sell you one for $130,

7611,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,0,"88000 is a lot of miles for a domestic vehicle though, it doesn't have much life left in it. Does it have GPS?",
7612,C_20edb3e4faa54e95b6d790f0d2e3ebd1,1,"I recently dropped the asking price for that reason but Lincoln's usually run over 100K easy so there is still some life left in it.  Yes, it has GPS plus backup camera.  I recently dropped the asking price.",

7904,C_cb7e2ca8c23c43ea8da0179f5135e848,1,The utilities are not included but we are a very energy efficient complex so the price on those should be very reasonable,

7906,C_cb7e2ca8c23c43ea8da0179f5135e848,1,"I am very willing to negotiate. However, that is half the asking price and would be unfair to the other renters. I would go 1900.00. there is also a microwave in most if that helps any and we would love to have your mom here.",

7946,C_91995f19b3664f4dad37c6b738be5bf4,0,I think that is very low for the age of the car but fair considering the price. My budget cannot handle quite the asking price. Are you open to accepting anything lower if I agree to pay cash?,
7947,C_91995f19b3664f4dad37c6b738be5bf4,1,If you can meet up today and pay in cash the lowest I am willing to accept would be $4000.00\,

I would be willing to meet up today and pay a higher price of $4410 if you could provide a full tank of gas and allow me to have a short test drive. i would also like to allow a mechanic at a local shop to inspect it while on the test drive. You can accompany me, of course.",
7951,C_91995f19b3664f4dad37c6b738be5bf4,1,I really need the $4000.00 for a down payment i really can't take any less. Not only that I can provide you the papers showing all the work that was done recently.,

7970,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,Yes it is actually very close to freeway access.,
7971,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,"Great! My only issue then is with the pricing, are you open to negotiate or no?",

7973,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,"Okay well I was thinking because of the location which isn't the best in town, how about we do 1500?",
7974,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,1,"$1,500 would be outrageously low and I cannot accept that offer. Can you come closer to 3000?",
7975,C_3aa03c24a06e45ec91e22578b686db5c,0,I'll do 2500 if utilities and internet are included in that monthly price and you waive the deposit.,

12027,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,1,"I am, in fact I had them made custom for a party where space was at a premium for the number of people. I don't really have use for that type of table any longer, that's why I need to sell them.",
12028,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,0,How long ago did you have them made?,
12029,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,1,Just a few months ago.,
12030,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,0,Were they out in the elements?,
12031,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,1,No they've been kept in a shed on my property. They're in perfect condition. I'm asking $75 for them.,
12032,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,0,Do they fold down?,
12033,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,1,"No, not really, they are solid iron frames with wood tops.",
12034,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,0,I would need to borrow my friends truck to get them. Would you be willing to go down to $60?,
12035,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,1,"I can do $65 if you come get them, or I can drop them off if you're not too far away, for the full $75.",
12036,C_b7640653088444a2b9be0dbfed078d8e,0,I will do the $65 and come pick them up.,
12200,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Are you interested in this Camry?,
12201,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,Hello!,
12202,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Hi!,
12203,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Lol, yes, I am interested. What can you tell me about it?",
12204,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Only one previous owner and I have all of the maintenance records. Service has been done regularly. Tires still have plenty of life. You can feel assured that the Carfax report is clean.,
12205,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Sounds good! Unfortunately I'm on a really tight budget. I""m a college student looking for a reliable ride. Would you take $4250 for the car?",
12206,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,I understand your situation. I also have a college student which is why I need to sell this car. We are downsizing to a one car family. The lowest I can go is $6900.,
12207,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Sounds like we're in the same boat. If I hit up my parents for a loan, I might be able to go up to $5900, but I don't think I could do much more, especially since it's 12 years old.",
12208,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Its very low mileage for that age. I'll take $6100 but that has to be a firm deal. I'll throw in a gas card for $50.,
12209,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,It's a deal! Thanks!,
12280,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,Hello! Are you interested in my property?,
12281,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"Hi, I saw your listing for the one bedroom apartment.",
12282,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"You're in luck! It's still available. It's a great apartment, 900 square feet, with a full kitchen and a balcony.",
12283,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,Sounds like a nice place. What security deposit is required?,
12284,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,It's a $400 deposit and for a lease of at least 12 months. It's a great location and all for only $2200.,
12285,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"12 month lease is perfect. The price is a little out of my range. I love the location, but I'm looking to pay 1500 a month. I'm a teacher on a limited budget.",
12286,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"I understand, I've got a lot of teachers in my family. I can't go as low as $1500, but I could do $1850. The place has a a gym and a pool and on site maintenance/manager.",
12287,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,Is it a full gym? I would be able to cancel my membership to my current gym!,
12288,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"Now you're thinking! Yes, it's full gym!",
12289,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"I'm a quiet tennet, always pay my rent on time, and I've got a long rental history. Without stretching myself too thin, I could do 1700 a month.",
12290,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"You know what? You're a good egg, so I'll take the 1700. You've got a deal!",
12291,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"Awesome, thank you!",
12327,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Hi how are you?,
12328,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Hello....Thanks....I am doing good...How about you?,
12329,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Very well do you have any questions about the bike 150 is a very fair price!,
12330,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,"The bike is indeed good one...I just wanted to check about the wear and tear...on scale of 1-5 (5 being brand new), how would you rate it?",
12331,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,I would give it a solid 4 my son did learn to ride on it so there is SOME evidence of use but very little.,
12332,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Thats great...and how old is the bike in months?,
12333,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,14 months old,
12334,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Ok...I recently bought a second hand Mountain bike roughly an year old for my elder son and had to change the tyres as it was kept in snow,
12335,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Ah that is not a problem at all the tires were replaced 3 months ago!,
12336,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,You had to change the tyres within a year for a brand new bike? Anyways its good to know....would you consider $65 for it? I can pick it up...it may sound way less...but I saw few more in that band,
12337,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,No that is less than my asking price and a very unfair price for a bike of this quality i would consider 110 and i can drop it off whenever you like.,
12338,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Its still more than the budget and market price even if you take a modest 20% depreciation,
12339,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,The lowest i am willing to go is $100. Will you accept that?,
12340,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Lets settle in between....my 65 and your 110....that would be $87,
12341,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Sure if tha's all you are willing to do,
12433,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,"Hello, is this Iphone still for sale?",
12434,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,1,Yes. It is still available and is in great condition.,
12435,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,Why are you selling this phone?,
12436,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,1,I changed carriers so I have to get a new phone from my new phone company.,
12437,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,How long have you had this phone?,
12438,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,1,I have had this phone since this version came out and have used it for the past couple years. I have always kept it in a hard case with a protective glass cover so it has no deep scratches or a broken/shattered glass.,
12439,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,Does this have a slot for a sd card?,
12440,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,1,"No, it does not. but it does have great memory available.",
12441,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,Seeing as this is a older Iphone would you take $70 cash?,
12442,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,1,If you picked up today I could do $80 cash and include a new hard case and a wall charger.,
12443,C_8ec5538404f04c19bbc198789a2d725c,0,That sounds good to me.,
12531,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,0,Hi i cannot see picture of the drawers,
12532,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,1,Hi! There are 2 nightstands with 2 drawers each and a dresser with 6 drawers. Its solid wood. They do have some scuffs and dings but you can barely notice them,
12533,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,0,Ok thanks. And these are included in the total cost?,
12534,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,1,"Yes everything is included. The nightstands, dresser and platform bed",
12535,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,0,Oh great. In that case i am willing to offer you $1000 Cheque,
12536,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,1,How about $1400 and I will deliver it,
12537,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,0,That is still out of budget for me. What if i raise cash for it and pay you $1100 cash?,
12538,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,1,$1280 final offer. Its a very good piece of furniture,
12539,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,0,The highest i can go is $1200. Deal?,
12540,C_128c181c5f4144b29a45fd518797ad57,1,Deal!,

12564,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,1,Okay we are asking 2750.  It is fully furnished and the price includes the cleaning services.,
12565,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,0,Would you be willing to negotiate the price?,
12566,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,1,We are pretty hard set on the 2750.  What would you like to pay the property?,
12567,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,0,I was thinking around $1900.,
12568,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,1,That is too far from our asking price.  However we are willing to come down to 2500,
12569,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,0,Could you waive the deposit if I pay 2500?,
12570,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,1,Yeah that would work for us if you are willing to give up the cleaning services,
12571,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,0,Yes. deal,
12572,C_d63781a4f4be4db387b20dcb5f0afdeb,1,okay great,

12586,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,"Hello, I see that you are interested in the 25pcs LED tube Lights.",
12587,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,"Yes,, are they all tested to be in good working condition?",
12588,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,They sure are and they also come with a one year warranty. They are well worth the price I'm asking of $200.,
12589,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,That's great. Are they packed individually?,
12590,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,Yes they are.,
12591,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,"Great. $200 seems a bit high, I have been pricing them on Amazon, and since I have prime shipping it would be free and quick. Is there any way you could sweeten the deal? I would be able to pick them up right away.",
12592,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,"Of course I am willing to negotiate for the right price. I am willing to go as low as $185, any lower than that? Probably not. How does that offer sound to you?",
12593,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,$185 is still a bit high considering I would have to come get them. I would like them quicker than amazon's 2 days but only if I could get a really good deal on them.  I was thinking more along the lines of $140,
12594,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,"Tell you what, if you can come get them today—I will let them go for $150. I understand your looking for a good deal, but I'm not going to break myself on this deal.",
12595,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,0,"That sounds fair. $150 is reasonable, I can do that.",
12596,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,Great! I will send you my address via email. See you soon.,

12658,C_2ead361ded154b91a6ca11be46b5a56c,1,"I don't want to come down too much.  This is already a steal. I can do 50,000.",

12830,C_c6a90f7d67e341be9bc9e1b5d2394bd8,1,Well the kitchen and bathrooms have been remodeled.  I also just added a wrap around deck.  How about $4700?,
12831,C_c6a90f7d67e341be9bc9e1b5d2394bd8,0,"That's an extremely fair offer. It's still slightly outside of my price range though, unfortunately. How about $4500?",
12832,C_c6a90f7d67e341be9bc9e1b5d2394bd8,1,It's in a very good neighborhood.  Very quiet and kid friendly.  Let's do $4600. Deal?,

12834,C_c6a90f7d67e341be9bc9e1b5d2394bd8,1,awesome!,
12866,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,Hello what's the mileage on your truck?,
12867,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,80k mostly highway miles.,
12868,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,what's the miles per gallon like on highway?,
12869,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,Around 18-24.,
12870,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"okay, that's not bad for a truck. You're asking 11500?",
12871,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,"Yes, which I think is more than fair considering the mileage and condition.",
12872,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,The mileage is great. The price seems high because of how old it is but I guess you just didn't drive it a lot. Are you the original owner?,
12873,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,"Yes, no accidents. Toyotas hold their values and run forever.",
12874,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"They do, I had a camry, but it was notorious for not starting if it sat too long without being cranked. Did you keep this truck in a garage while you weren't using it?",
12875,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,The truck was garage kept. I am willing to sell it for 11k cash.,
12876,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"That still seems like a lot for a vehicle that's over a decade old. I'll have to do a tune up on it, new spark plugs, hoses, etc.",
12877,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,10.5k is the lowest I'll go. I just listed and others have expressed interest.,
12878,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"Right, well thank you for your time then",
12879,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Hey I am interested in renting this place if it is still available?,
12880,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,It sure is as of now anyways,
12881,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,I have 10 classmates and myself and this place would be perfect as it is close to campus.,
12882,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,It sounds like you need all the room you can get. Do you have any questions about it?,
12883,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Does it include any ammenities?,
12884,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,"Oh absolutely! It is Cable/DSL Ready , 2 blocks from campus and  1.5 blocks from Telegraph avenue, it has 2 full bathrooms, washer/Dryer unit, On-Site office management team and it is a clean well-run apartment building. It has a brand new kitchen as well.",
12885,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water.  We are poor graduate students.,
12886,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want.",
12887,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Okay we will take it.,
12888,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,Awesome! Thank you for everything,

12904,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,Yes correct.,
12905,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,I noticed the photos aren't of the actual unit. Is this a unit on the property or just a unit that is similar?,
12906,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,They are very similar pretty much look just alike.,
12907,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,Awesome. How much wiggle room do you have on that price. It's a big high for me.,
12908,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,If you can pay today I will drop it down to $1600.,
12909,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,Would you be willing to go down to 1400 if I sign a longer lease?,
12910,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,How about $1450 for one year lease.,
12911,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,That would work for me. You got a deal!,
12912,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,0,"Hello, I saw your listing and I'm interested in your apartment. Can you tell me more about it?",

12914,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,0,"That sounds good, would you happen to know what's in the area?",
12915,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,1,"It's right near a bart station, to public transit is easy. I don't know about the schools. I've heard they're good but I don't have kids so... Pretty good night life if that's what you're looking for. Not too far from the ocean, always a good thing.",
12916,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,0,"Everything sounds good. Except for the price, unfortunately. How does $2000 sound?",
12917,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,1,that's almost a thousand lower than I was hoping for. Can you do 2500?,
12918,C_e86196aa15304f2fb2394583ffc0bfdf,0,"I suppose I could stretch that much. It is a nice apartment, after all.",

13196,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen.  Would you be interested in it?,
13197,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?",
13198,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,as far as I know it does.  The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke.  My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,
13199,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,Can you get those screens repaired?,

14421,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,0,Hello! I was interested in the Audi you had listed for sale. I had a few questions if you could answer them for me?,
14422,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,1,Go ahead and ask away!,
14423,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,0,How is the condition of the outside of the car and inside?,
14424,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,1,It's as perfect as it can be. I've always tried to give it as much love as possible.,
14425,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,0,Has it ever been in an accident?,
14426,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,1,"No it hasn't, I'm the only one who drives it and I've never been in an accident in my life.",
14427,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,0,"Awesome! I'd love to come and see it, but I was wondering if you would be open to taking less for it? I was hoping around $2700.00",
14428,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,1,"Unfortunately, I can't go close to that low on it.",
14429,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,0,"Highest I can go would be $2900, but I understand if that's too low.",
14430,C_5ca790a297c8411688430ad8b04fa96e,1,Are you sure you couldn't go to 3500. I've got this awesome system that I can install in there for you by Alpine. It supports Android Auto and Apple Carplay and it's wireless unlike some of the systems out there. It usually sells for around $900.,
14456,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Hi! I see you are interested in my tablet.,
14457,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Yes I am.  It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,
14458,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.,
14459,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Does it come with a warranty?,
14460,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.,
14461,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Did a child play with it?,
14462,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.,
14463,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"May I ask, why are you selling it?",
14464,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price.",
14465,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking.  Will you take $90?,
14466,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal.",
14467,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"If you can ship it to me and include those accessories, I can go to $125 paid immediately.",
14468,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra.",
14469,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Well then $150 seems reasonable.  I can manage that.,
14470,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Ok. I guess so.,
14471,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"Okay then it's a deal -- $150 shipped with accessories,",

14716,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,1,"Well, you're right by downtown, so you can find everything you need within a short drive.",
14717,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,0,That's true. I am very much interested but the price is way way high for me. Is that something we can work on?,
14718,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,1,"Well, I have a little bit of room to negotiate, but this is already a huge steal at only $2400 a month.",
14719,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,0,I can afford $1680? I mean I could do some volunteering work if that helps to make up for the price?,
14720,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,1,"Well, If you can come up to $1900, I think we'd have a deal.",

16049,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,Hello!,
16050,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Hi!,
16051,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Lol, yes, I am interested. What can you tell me about it?",
16052,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Only one previous owner and I have all of the maintenance records. Service has been done regularly. Tires still have plenty of life. You can feel assured that the Carfax report is clean.,
16053,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Sounds good! Unfortunately I'm on a really tight budget. I""m a college student looking for a reliable ride. Would you take $4250 for the car?",
16054,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,I understand your situation. I also have a college student which is why I need to sell this car. We are downsizing to a one car family. The lowest I can go is $6900.,
16055,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,"Sounds like we're in the same boat. If I hit up my parents for a loan, I might be able to go up to $5900, but I don't think I could do much more, especially since it's 12 years old.",
16056,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,1,Its very low mileage for that age. I'll take $6100 but that has to be a firm deal. I'll throw in a gas card for $50.,
16057,C_22d011f390744fabbe316b99098c739b,0,It's a deal! Thanks!,

16166,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"You're in luck! It's still available. It's a great apartment, 900 square feet, with a full kitchen and a balcony.",
16167,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,Sounds like a nice place. What security deposit is required?,
16168,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,It's a $400 deposit and for a lease of at least 12 months. It's a great location and all for only $2200.,
16169,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"12 month lease is perfect. The price is a little out of my range. I love the location, but I'm looking to pay 1500 a month. I'm a teacher on a limited budget.",
16170,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"I understand, I've got a lot of teachers in my family. I can't go as low as $1500, but I could do $1850. The place has a a gym and a pool and on site maintenance/manager.",
16171,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,Is it a full gym? I would be able to cancel my membership to my current gym!,
16172,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"Now you're thinking! Yes, it's full gym!",
16173,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,0,"I'm a quiet tennet, always pay my rent on time, and I've got a long rental history. Without stretching myself too thin, I could do 1700 a month.",
16174,C_24216282238b45a48c83cb22f72f9888,1,"You know what? You're a good egg, so I'll take the 1700. You've got a deal!",

16221,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Hello....Thanks....I am doing good...How about you?,
16222,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Very well do you have any questions about the bike 150 is a very fair price!,
16223,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,"The bike is indeed good one...I just wanted to check about the wear and tear...on scale of 1-5 (5 being brand new), how would you rate it?",
16224,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,I would give it a solid 4 my son did learn to ride on it so there is SOME evidence of use but very little.,
16225,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Thats great...and how old is the bike in months?,
16226,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,14 months old,
16227,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Ok...I recently bought a second hand Mountain bike roughly an year old for my elder son and had to change the tyres as it was kept in snow,
16228,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Ah that is not a problem at all the tires were replaced 3 months ago!,
16229,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,You had to change the tyres within a year for a brand new bike? Anyways its good to know....would you consider $65 for it? I can pick it up...it may sound way less...but I saw few more in that band,
16230,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,No that is less than my asking price and a very unfair price for a bike of this quality i would consider 110 and i can drop it off whenever you like.,
16231,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Its still more than the budget and market price even if you take a modest 20% depreciation,
16232,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,The lowest i am willing to go is $100. Will you accept that?,
16233,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,0,Lets settle in between....my 65 and your 110....that would be $87,
16234,C_24d2bc5b2da04759ab7b545bb93cf9d1,1,Sure if tha's all you are willing to do,
16321,C_db418afe4c8d4a7582c50f3d0cf57285,1,Hello. Are you interested in this fine car I am selling?,

16607,C_5d8021e0a7284d25921e67797e6fd177,1,They sure are and they also come with a one year warranty. They are well worth the price I'm asking of $200.,

17003,C_81a2adf8cc214294a3c0498dc14d5853,0,Thanks. That's an older model than I was looking for but the low mileage is good. Would you consider taking $1600 for it?,

17031,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"okay, that's not bad for a truck. You're asking 11500?",
17032,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,"Yes, which I think is more than fair considering the mileage and condition.",
17033,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,The mileage is great. The price seems high because of how old it is but I guess you just didn't drive it a lot. Are you the original owner?,
17034,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,"Yes, no accidents. Toyotas hold their values and run forever.",
17035,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"They do, I had a camry, but it was notorious for not starting if it sat too long without being cranked. Did you keep this truck in a garage while you weren't using it?",
17036,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,The truck was garage kept. I am willing to sell it for 11k cash.,
17037,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,0,"That still seems like a lot for a vehicle that's over a decade old. I'll have to do a tune up on it, new spark plugs, hoses, etc.",
17038,C_161badd70b8e4f6c9cf7ac096e94d9ad,1,10.5k is the lowest I'll go. I just listed and others have expressed interest.,

It has a brand new kitchen as well.",
17055,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water. We are poor graduate students.,
17056,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want.",
17057,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,0,Okay we will take it.,
17058,C_35befe5b594947f49c4d5e9e3d4acdc3,1,Awesome! Thank you for everything,

17093,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,I noticed the photos aren't of the actual unit. Is this a unit on the property or just a unit that is similar?,
17094,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,They are very similar pretty much look just alike.,
17095,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,Awesome. How much wiggle room do you have on that price. It's a big high for me.,
17096,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,1,If you can pay today I will drop it down to $1600.,
17097,C_1a051b6f66e84b4ca218cfe83302ead2,0,Would you be willing to go down to 1400 if I sign a longer lease?,

17372,C_b351d35d35ba45539196bf3b903c7cbb,1,That's a little low. These cars go forever. Lot's of mileage still left on the vehicle.,

17460,C_a8aa96d967bd4b759973df9d6c2bdf70,1,I really want to get a Nissan Leaf so I don't think that will work. I could come down to 7000 if you have cash.,
17461,C_a8aa96d967bd4b759973df9d6c2bdf70,0,Yeah my low end is 3750. What about 5500 now and 1500 when I sell the charger?,

17536,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone. I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen. Would you be interested in it?,
17537,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?",
17538,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,0,as far as I know it does. The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke. My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,
17539,C_d89c181133f94dfc9c6959bd27f7e0c3,1,Can you get those screens repaired?,

17814,C_45db1e1be6d04ba59061fd26fb312eef,1,"Absolutely I do. He's not very tech savvy, so he asked me to sell it for him. Like I said in the listing, it's in excellent condition, with only a scuff near the charging port (probably from him trying to plug it in in the dark, haha). We're looking to sell it for $450, but I'm willing to negotiate on the price.",

17857,C_6bcd5d5d1d6344588d0bd54bed58c570,1,That is great that you are trying to be active! The only reason I am selling the bike it's because we are moving and I can't take it with me could you possibly do a little bit more?,

18879,C_3dcb2df802da4ea08e0ea3327bdd3141,1,I could probably do that since the mattress is not included. You have to pick it up today.,
18880,C_3dcb2df802da4ea08e0ea3327bdd3141,0,Done! Thank you!,

18889,C_5b9185c283eb4b60a64091e74d8f799b,1,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price.",

19126,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Hi! I see you are interested in my tablet.,
19127,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Yes I am. It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,
19128,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.,
19129,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Does it come with a warranty?,
19130,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.,
19131,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Did a child play with it?,
19132,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.,

19134,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price.",
19135,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking. Will you take $90?,
19136,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal.",
19137,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,"If you can ship it to me and include those accessories, I can go to $125 paid immediately.",
19138,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,1,"I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra.",
19139,C_8df933f5a33348b395b8515811028239,0,Well then $150 seems reasonable. I can manage that.,

19165,C_844ffc3bcc0f4b24a7910899d744416a,0,Ok great! Would you take $40 if I pick them up today?,
19166,C_844ffc3bcc0f4b24a7910899d744416a,1,"I would like to get $45 out of them. They are in great shape, no cracks or marks at all.",

19468,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,0,That's true. I am very much interested but the price is way way high for me. Is that something we can work on?,
19469,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,1,"Well, I have a little bit of room to negotiate, but this is already a huge steal at only $2400 a month.",
19470,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,0,I can afford $1680? I mean I could do some volunteering work if that helps to make up for the price?,
19471,C_4f05fa2da2e14d3999b0c83b7069bdbd,1,"Well, If you can come up to $1900, I think we'd have a deal.",
